    "## 自定义输出解析器\n",
    "\n",
    "在某些情况下，您可能希望实现自定义解析器以将模型输出构造为自定义格式。\n",
    "\n",
    "有两种方法可以实现自定义解析器：\n",
    "- 在 LCEL 中使用 RunnableLambda 或 RunnableGenerator – 我们强烈建议大多数用例使用此方法\n",
    "- 通过从基类之一继承进行解析——这是困难方法\n",
    "\n",
    "这两种方法之间的差异大多是表面的，主要在于触发哪些回调（例如， on_chain_start 与 on_parser_start ）\n",
    "\n",
    "### 可运行的 Lambda 和生成器\n",
    "\n",
    "推荐的解析方法是使用可运行的 lambda 和可运行的生成器！\n",
    "\n",
    "在这里，我们将进行一个简单的解析，反转模型输出的大小写。\n",
    "\n",
    "例如，如果模型输出：“Meow”，解析器将生成“mEOW”。\n"
