This has led us to develop TraditionData, a division dedicated to data commercialisation either directly or through data vendors. TraditionData has its own product specialists and universe of clients. Initially viewed as an ancillary business, it is becoming core with significant growth opportunities. First, clients are looking for independent sources of reliable price and volume information for OTC markets, and the addressable market is expanding for realtime, end of day, historical data sets and also analytics. Tradition and its peers are also lagging behind the exchanges in terms of ability to monetise their data assets. Finally, TraditionData is still small in terms of percentage of total revenues compared to the benchmark in our industry. ",

For risk management purposes the Group separates this risk into two types - transactional liquidity risk and balance sheet liquidity risk. Transactional liquidity risk concerns the Group's ability to meet cash flows related to matched principal trades or the requirements of market counterparties, for instance, the need to fund securities in the process of settlement or to place margin calls or collateral with clearing houses or banks which provide clearing services to the Group. These liquidity demands are hard to anticipate but are normally short term, overnight or even intra-day and are usually met from overdrafts with the clearing entity. In order to manage these risks the Group ensures that its subsidiaries engaged in matched principal trading hold cash or cash equivalents sufficient to meet potential funding requirements using a statistical approach based on historical data, which is stress tested to establish an appropriate level of contingency funding. Balance sheet liquidity risk is the risk that a Group entity will be unable to meet its net working capital needs over a certain period of time due to trading difficulties or significant investments in the business. To manage this risk, the Group's main operating entities prepare rolling twelve-month cash flow forecasts as part of the monthly financial reporting process in order to identify any potential liquidity issues. At the very least, all entities retain sufficient cash or cash equivalents to meet expected net cash outflows for the next three months. Controls are carried out on a timely basis to identify funds which are surplus to local requirements for up-streaming to the Group's holding companies, where working capital or structural cash requirements are identified and addressed. At the holding company level, the Group has set up financing via bond issues and a credit facility (disclosed in Note 20) which strengthens its cash position and its ability to manage liquidity risks.

In addition to general market monitoring and targeting improvements in areas such as security and swaps based trading, the Russian invasion of Ukraine remained a focal point as U.S. regulators and participants continued to monitor the effects of the conflict on global and domestic financial markets. U.S. regulators sought to ensure that the financial services community was upholding sanctions imposed by the U.s. Government. High-profile failures in the crypto and digital asset marketplace resulted in heightened activity within U.S. government bodies and the wider regulatory community. The meltdown of the crypto exchange FTX, and continued concerns about the stability of this new trading sector, fuelled ongoing debates on all U.S. government and regulatory fronts as to how the digital-asset landscape should evolve from a governance, investment, trading and riskmanagement perspective.

With both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTc) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) focused on the effects of climate change, in 2022, the SEC proposed significant new requirements to enhance and standardise disclosures regarding climate-related risks. Unlike existing climate and EsG disclosure requirements, which have Iargely been principles-based, the new proposal, while still including materiality thresholds, also includes more prescriptive line-item requirements. These proposed requirements would apply to domestic registrants as well as foreign private issuers. Around the same time, the CFTC announced the creation of the CFTC's multidivisional Climate Risk Unit (CRu) to better understand the role of derivatives in pricing and mitigating climate-related risk. This unit will also work to support the orderly transition to a low-carbon economy through market-based initiatives and product innovation. In 2022, both agencies committed to increasing focus on cybersecurity, particularly disclosure requirements to enhance and standardise public company disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management and incident reporting.

Retirement benefits are defined on the basis of the individual's retirement savings account balance (retirement savings capital) at the retirement date. The annual retirement pension is calculated by multiplying the retirement savings capital at the retirement date by the conversion rate defined in the foundation's pension plan rules. Employees may opt to take early retirement from age 58, in which case the conversion rate is reduced proportionally, to take account of the expected increase in the duration of pension payments and the lower retirement savings capital.
