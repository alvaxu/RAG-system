# Dear Fellow CrossFirst Stockholder

I always look forward to this annual opportunity to share an update on CrossFirst's financial performance.   
as well as offer a preview of what's to come in the year ahead.

As we entered last year, we did so under the mantra of "always accelerating" The idea was to build on the solid framework we already had in place and position ourselves for future success The always accelerating mindset and approach i core to what we do and who we are at Crossirst, and last year's results prove that. One of the major drivers of growth was our acquisition of Central, giving CrossFirst a presence in Colorado and New Mexico for the first time.

In addition to expansion through acquisition, we also continue to grow organically in other markets particularly in Arizona and North Texas. The leadership teams we have in place in these locations are second to none and fully committed to building our brand and expanding our offerings in those fast-growing communities. Coing forward. we will continue to be opportunistic in evaluating acquisition targets, looking for partners that are strong strategic and cultural fits to CrossFirst.

In terms of 2022 financial performance, we reported $\$ 68.6$ million in adjusted net income for the year, or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $\$ 1.37$ . We also grew loans by $2 6 \%$ for the year, with $7 7 \%$ of that growth being organic, and demand deposits grew from $7 \%$ to $2 5 \%$ of total deposits. When we look back to our initial public offering in August 2019, and all that has happened at the Bank and to our industry and country since, I am incredibly proud of the progress we have made. We have worked hard to deploy the capital we raised during the IPO through organic balance sheet growth, share buybacks, and now a successful acquisition. Since our IPO:

. We have grown our balance sheet by $\$ 1.7$ billion or over $3 3 \%$   
. Demand deposits have grown from $7 \%$ to $2 5 \%$ of total deposits   
. Net Interest Margin - Fully Tax Equivalent ("FTE') has improved from 3.32% for 2019 to 3.50% for 2022   
. Credit quality has substantially improved with our non-performing assets ratio declining from $0 . 9 7 \%$ as of the end of 2019 to only $0 . 2 0 \%$ as of the end of 2022   
. Operating revenue has grown to $\$ 271$ million in 2022. That is an increase of $\$ 67$ million or more than $40 \%$ from our total operating revenue in 2019   
. Adjusted ROE improved from $5 . 7 8 \%$ in 2019 to 11.11% in 2022

As we look to 2023 and the years ahead, we are focused on optimizing growth. We continue to make significant investments in our people, processes, and technology platorms, and this year we are committed to optimizing those investments to benefit our clients and our financial performance. We know there continues to be economic uncertainty given continued inflation, a high interest rate environment, and the ongoing threat of recession. Regardles of what may happen outside of our control, Iam confident in our team's ability to continually deliver extraordinary service and help our clients achieve their financial dreams.

In closing, I want to thank you, our stockholders. Your investment in CrossFirst reflects your confidence in us We willnever stop working to create and deliver value for our employees, our clients, and our communities as One Team, operating as One Bank, with a Shared Vision.

Sincerely, 40 Mly

# General

We are extensively regulated under U.S. federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, ut also by federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Ofice of te State Bank Commissioner of Kansas, the Federal Reerve, the FederaDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC") and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS") and state and local taxing authorities accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), scurities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (EC) an state scuritis authorities and AntiMoney Laundering (\*AML) laws enforced by the U.S. Deparment of the Treasury also impact our business.

# Regulatory Capital Requirements

The federal banking agencies require that banking organizations meet several risk-based capital adequacy requirements known as the "Base II Caital Rules. The Basel I Capital Rule implement the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Basel II Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to comply with four minimum capital standards: (i) a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least $4 . 0 \%$ ; (ii) a CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least $4 . 5 \%$ ; (iii) a tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least $6 . 0 \%$ ; and (iv) a total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least $8 . 0 \%$ . CET1 capital is generally comprised of common stockholders' equity and retained eanings subject to aplicable relatory austments. Tier 1 captal i graly comprised of CE1 and addtional tier 1 capitl. dditional tier 1 capitl geely includes crin nonmulative peral prefred stock and relat surplus and morit ntts in eqity accounts f consolidae subsidries. We are pemitted to inlude qualfying tust prferre seuritie isued prior to May 19, 2010 as addtionl ir 1 capital. Total capital includes tier 1 capital (CET1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital) and tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is generally comprised of capital intruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferd stock and longterm perpetal prferre stock, mandary converible suritie, inmedate prferre stock, ad subordated debt. Alo iludd in tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit oses (ACL) formerly known as the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), limite to a maximum of $1 . 2 5 \%$ of risk-weighted assets. The calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.

The Basel III Capital Rules also establish a "capital conservation buffer' of $2 . 5 \%$ above the regulatory minimum risk-based capita requirements. An institution is subject to limitations on certain activities, including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers, if its capital level is below the buffered ratio.

The Basel II minimum capital ratios as applicable to the Bank and to the Company are summarized in the table below:

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Basel III Minimum For Capital Adequacy</td><td>Basel III Additional Capital Conservation</td><td>Basel III Ratio With Capital Conservation</td></tr><tr><td>Total risk based capital (total capital to risk-weighted assets).</td><td>Purposes 8.00%</td><td>Buffer 2.50%</td><td>Buffer 10.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 1 risk based capital (tier 1 to risk-weighted assets).</td><td>6.00</td><td>2.50</td><td>8.50</td></tr><tr><td>Common equity tier 1 risk based capital (CET1 to risk-weighted assets)</td><td>4.50</td><td>2.50</td><td>7.00</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 1 leverage ratio (tier 1 to average assets)</td><td>4.00%</td><td>%</td><td>4.00%</td></tr></table></body></html>

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a banking organization's assets, including c off-balae het aes are multipled y aisk wight factor asigned y the elations bas on reied risks herent in the type of asset. As a result, higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company's and the Bank's capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy guideline percentag. requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules.

# Prompt Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires federal banking agencies to take \*prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minmum capital requirements. For purposes of prompt corrctive action, the law establishes five capital tiers. "well-atalized, dequately-capitalizd \*nder-capitalied \*ignificantly under-apitalized," and criticlly under-capitalized." A depository intition's captal ter depends on its capital els and certain ther factors stablished by reulation. In order to be awellcapitalized' depository institution, a bank must maintain a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of $6 . 5 \%$ or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of $8 \%$ or more, a total risk-based capital ratio of $10 \%$ or more and a leverage ratio of $5 \%$ or more (and is not subject to any order or written drective speifying any hgher capital ratio. At each successively lower capitl caeory, a bank i subject to inaseetrictions on its operations.

As of December 31, 2022, the Bank met the requirements for being deemed \*well-apitalized' for purposes of the prompt orrective action regulations and was not otherwise subject to any order or written directive specifying any higher capital ratios.

This gneral prohibitio i suject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage i, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be "so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto."

Additionally, bank holding companies that mee certain eligibilit requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activties, including securite and insurance underwritig and sale, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation withthe Secretary of the Treasury, detmines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve detemines by order tobe complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundnessof depository instittions o th financial stem generall.

Dividend Payments, Stock Redemptions and Repurchases

The Company's ability to pay dividends to it stockholders is affected by both general corporate law considerations and the regulations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies, including the Basel I Capital Rules. Generally, a Kansas corporation may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock thr out of its surplus, as defined in and computed in accordance with .. 17-6404 and 176604, and amendments thereto, o i ase there is not any surplus, out of its net profits for th isal year in which the dividend i declared or the prceding fiscal year, or both If the capital of the corporation, computed in accordance with K.S.A. 17-6404 and 17-60, and amendments thereto, i dimnished by depreciation in the value of its property, or by losse, r otherwise, to an amount essthan the ggrat mount of th capil reresented by the ied and oustandig stock of allclas ving a preferne upon the disttion f asts, then diidnds may be paid ut of suchnt profits until the dfciy in the amount of capil eresented by the issued and outstanding stock of all lasses having a preference upon the distribution of asets shall have been repaired.

It is the Federal Reserve's policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's expected future needs and financial condition I is also the Federal Reerve's policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend lels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiarie. Additionall, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levelsunless both asset quality and capital are very strong.

Bank holding companies must consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming any equity or other capital instrument included in tier 1 or tier 2 capital prior to stated maturity, if such redemption could have a material efct on the level or composition of the organization's capital base. In addition, bank holding companies are unable to repurchase shares equal to $10 \%$ or more of their net worth if they would not be well-capitalized (as defined by the Federal Resere) afer giving effect to such repurchase. Bank holding companies experiencing financial weaknesses, o that are at sfican riskf developing financial wakneses, must consult with the Fedral Reserve before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital instruments.

# Deposit Insurance

As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a riskbased assment systemwhe FDIC-insured dosiory intitions pay insurance premms at rates based on ther rik classfication. An institution's risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concen the institution poses to the regulators. For deposit insurance aessment urposes, an insured depository instittion is placed in one of four risk catgories ech quarter. An instittion's asment i dmned b mutplyig its asment rat  it asssment be. The tol se asment rates ange from 2.5 basis points to 42 basis points. While n the past an insured depository instittion's asessment base was demined by its depost base, amendments to the Fedral Deposit Insurance Act revised theasssment bas so that i i callatd using arage consolidat tal assets minus average tangible equity.

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from $1 . 1 5 \%$ to $1 . 3 5 \%$ of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC had until September 3, 2020 to meet the $1 . 3 5 \%$ reserve ratio target, but it announced in November 2018 that the DIF had reached $1 . 3 6 \%$ , exceeding the $1 . 3 5 \%$ reserve ratio target. At least semi-annually, the FDIC upates its os and income ojection for th DF and f neded, may incrase or decreasethe asessment rates followng notice and comment on proposed rule-making. However, as of June 30, 2020, the reserve ratio fell to $1 . 3 0 \%$ , below the statutory minimum of $1 . 3 5 \%$ On September 15, 2020, the FDIC adopted a Restoration Plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least $1 . 3 5 \%$ within eight years. The FDIC projects that the reserve ratio will return to $1 . 3 5 \%$ without further action by the FDIC before the end of that eight-year period, but the FDIC will cloely monor deosit balce treds, pntil lose, and ther facors tht affct the ere ratio. s a eult, the Banks FI deposit insurance premiums could increase or decrease.

The audit commitee must include at least two members with experience in banking or related financial management, must have acces to outside counsel and must not include representatives of large clients.

Concentration risk exists when financial intittions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. Concentration stemming from CRE is one area of regulatory concen. The CRE Concentration Guidance, provides supervisory criteria, including the following umerical indicators, toassist bank exaners i identifying anks with potentilly significant CRE loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) CRE loans exceeding $300 \%$ of capital and increasing $50 \%$ or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding $100 \%$ of capital. The CRE Concentration Guidance does not limit banks' levels of CRE lending ativities, ut rather gudes institions in develoing risk managment practic and leels of capital that are comensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentrations. If aconcentration is preent, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: (i) board and management oversight and strategic planning; (i) porfolio management, (i) development of underwriting standards; iv) risk assesment and monitorig through market analysis and stessteting, and (v) maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. On Decmber 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies jointly isued atatement on prudent risk management for commercial real este lending reminding finncial institutions of developing risk management practice.

# Incentive Compensation Guidance

The federal bank regulatory agencies have isued comprehensive guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expetations for banking organizations conceming their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk managment, onrol and goveance proceses. The incentive compnsation udance, which covers all mployees that hve the bilit to mrily at the rik profef a oztio, h ny or as par f group, is pon th imay pre. () balanced risk-taking inntives; ) omatibility with ffective contros and risk managment, and  strong cororat ovance. Any deficiencie i compsation prctes tht are identified may be incorated into the organiztions supervisory ratings, which can ffct its ability to make aqsitions or take other actions. In addition, under the incntive compensation guidance, a banking oranization's federl

supervisor may intiate enforement actio if th organations inentie compensatio angments pose  risk to th safety and soundness of the organtion. urthr, the Basel  ca ules limit dctoary bous payments to bank xties if the instttion's rulatory capital ratos fail to exced certain thresholds. Although the federal bank relatory agecies proposed adtional rule in 2016 related to incentive compensation for all banks with more than $\$ 1$ billion in assets, those rules have not yet been finalized. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators policies on exective compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near fure.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to include, at least once every thre years, a separate non-binding say-on-pay" vote in their proxy statement by which stockholders may vote on the compensation of the public company's named executive offier. n addition, if uch ublic ompanes are inoled n a merger, aqustio, or consldtion, r if thy roose to selor dsose of allr ustantiyall f their assets stockholders have a right to an advisory vote on any golden parachute arrangements in connection with such transaction (frequentl referred to as say-on-golden parachute" vote). Other provisions of the Dod-Frank Act may impact our corporate governance. For instance, the SEC adopted rules prohbiting the listing of any equty security ofa company that does not have compensation commitee consisting solely of independent dirctors subjecto certain eceptions. In addition, the SEC adopted rules requiring allexchange-traded companies to adopt claw-back policies for incntive compensation pad to exeutive offcers in the event faccounting rtaements based on material non-compliance with financial reporting requirment, as required under Dod-Frank. Those rule, however, remain subject t final isting standards to be isued by national securities exchanges. Adtionall, the Company is an emerging growth company (GC) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \*JOBS Act) and therefore subject to reduced disclosure requirements related to, among other things, executive compensation.

# Financial Privacy

The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules that limt the ability of banks and other financial intittions to disclose nonpublic information about consumersto non-affiliate hrd parties. These limtations require discosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances, aow consumers to revet diclosure of cin personal fomation to  nonafiliated thid part. These rlations affect how consumer information is transmitted through financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent discoure of certn infomation among affiliate companies that i assembled or used o detemne eligibility for aproduct or service, such as that shown on consumer credit rorts and asset and income infomatio from applicatios. Cosumers also have the option to direct banks and ther fnancial intittions nt t share infomation about ransactions and exprice with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.

# Impact of Monetary Policy

The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has asignificant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the Federal Reerve to ffect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. govenment scurities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in resere requirements against member bank deposits. Thee toos are used in varying combinations to inlence ovral growth and disribution of bank lons, investments and deposits. and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.

Risks Relating to Our Business and Market

# A decline in general busines and economic conditions and any regulatory responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.

Our business and operations, which primaril consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans and borrowing money from clients in the form of deosits, are sensitive to geral economic conditions, particularly in Kansas, Missouri, Okahma, Texas, Arizona Colorado and New Mexico.

# We may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends.

We may not be able to sustain our growth at the rate we have enjoyed during the past several years, which has been driven primarily by new markt expansion, thestrngth f ommercial and indstrial and eal etate lendg in our market as and or abilit to identify and attrac high caliber experienced banking talent. A downturn in local economic market conditions, our failure toattract and retain high performing personnel and th inabilit to atract core funding and qualit lending clients, among ther factors, could limit or ality to grow at the rate we have in the past. Additionally, expenses may grow at a greater rat than revenues. Consequentl, our historical results of perations wl nt nesarly be indctie f r fur rtion.

# We may not be able to manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth and expansion through de novo branching, nergers and acquisitions, new lines of business, or new offerings of services, products or product enhancements.

If our busines continues to grow as anticipated, we may become more susceptible to riss related to both general growth and specific areas of growth. Geneally, risks are asociated wth atmpting to mananeffetive financial d opational ontros as we grow, such as maintaining appropriate loan underwritig and credit monitoring procedures, maintaning an adequate allowance for loan losses,controlling concentrations and complying with regulatory or acounting requirements. Such riss may result in, among other efects, increased loan losse, rcd ngs, ptial rlaory ties and fe etrictions ngrowth. We may so e exose torn ris ssociated with the specific components of our growth strategy, as discussed in more detail below.

Expansion through De Novo Branching: Our growth strategy includes evaluating opportunities to grow through de novo branching De novo branching carries with it certain potential riss, including significant startup costs and anticipated initial operating losses an inabilit to gain regulatory pproval; an inability to hire o retain qualified senior management to successflly operat the branch and integrate our corporate culture; challenges associated with securing atractive locations at reasonable cost poor market reception in locations where we do not have a preexisting reputation, unfavorable local economic conditions; and the additional train on management resources and internal systems and controls.

Mergers and Acquisitions: As part of our growth strategy, we may continue to pursue mergers and acquisitions of banks and nonbank financial services companies within or outside our principal market areas. Mergers and acquisitions, including our recently completed acquistion of Farmers & Stockmens Bank, involve numerous risks associated with entry into new markets or locations; integration and management of the combined entities; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations; assumption of unanticipaed problems, such as non-perfoming los and laen bilities; unanticipatd costs; and potential fute mpaments to gowil and other intangible assets If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertibl debt or equity securitie, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could affc the market price of our common stock. As a condition to reeving regulatory aproval, we may also be required to sell banking locations, which may not be preferable or may reduce the benefit of the acquisition. The failureto obtain these reulatory approvals could impact our business plans and restrict our growth.

New Lines of Business, Services, Products or Product Enhancements: From time to time, we may implement or acquire new lines of businessor ffer new services, products or product enhancements. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with developing, implementing and marketing such offerings, including significant investment of financial and other resources, inability to acrately tat price d tiit s  i x ft, y cmlie and shing mrkt pre.

Failure to adequately manage any of the preceding risks could have an adverse efect on our busines, financial condition and resul of operations.

# Phase-out of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR") and uncertainty relating to alternative reference rates may adversely affect our results of operations.

LIBOR is used extensively as areferece rate for various financial conracts, including adjustable-rate loans asset-backed securities and inteest rat swaps. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authorit, which regulates LIBOR, nnounced th i intends to stop persuading or compelling banks tosubmit LIBOR rates after 2021, which date was later extended to June 30, 2023. Accordingly, continuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed ater June 30, 2023 and altemative reference rates must be established. Regulators, industry groups ancrtn comttes , the Atative Refrence Ra mmte hae, ong hr things, ublishd recomendd fallack language fo IBOR-inked finncil inments, dfied eommedd altives for ce IBR rates . th Sured Omight Financing Rate (SOFR") as the recommended altemative to U.S. Dollr LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended altenatives in floating rate instrument. Management ontinues to valuate the impact of this trnsition as it relates to new and existing contracts and clients and has inluded fallack language in new loan documents since 2017. Starting in 2021, we no longer use LIBOR on new loans.

Uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, inluding the value of, retu on and trading market for our financial ats and libilies that ae basd n or are linked to benchmarks, inluding any LIBOR-basd seurities, lons and deriatives. Fuhmore, thre can be no assuraes that we and thr mark participants wil be adequately prepared for an actual discontinuation of benchmarks, including LIBOR, that may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics (including, but not limited to, interest raes to be paid to or by us), which may also result in adversely affecting our financial condtion or reults of operations. Such tansition may also reult in itigation with counterpartie impacted by the transition as well as increased regulatory scrutiny and other adverse consequences. In addition, any replacement benchmark ultimately adopted as a substitute for LIBOR, including SOFR, may behave differently than LIBOR in a manner detrimental to our financial performance. At December 31, 2022, \$0.7 billion of our loans were tied to LIBOR.

# The fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.

As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately \$687 million, $\$ 746$ million and \$655 million, respectively. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and may cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these secrities. These factors include, but are not limited to rating agency actio, fats b th ier h t the nd rite, hng  mak t r  bit n the apt markets. n addition, our inability to accuratly predict the future perfomance f an issuer or to efficiently respond to changing market conditions could result in a decline in the value of our investment securities portfolio. These and other factors could cause realized or unrealized loses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income and the value of our common stock, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

# Our business is highly susceptible to credit risk.

There are riss inherent in making any loan, including riss inherent in dealing with individual borrowers risks of non-payment, risks resulting fromucies a to the fure ale f collrl and riss ultig fromchange i oic and indstry conditions. There is no assurance that r lon approl and cedit risk montring procdres are or will be adequate to rece the nherent risks asocited wth ending.

# We have credit exposure to the energy industry.

We have cedit exposure to the energy industry in each of our primary markets and acrossthe United States. A downturn or lack of growth in the energy industry and energy-related busines could adversely affect our clients which may lead to higher delinquencies and greater charg-off in futre prios. Prolonged or further pricing pressure on oil and ga could led to incrd credit stes in our energy portfolio, increased losses associated wth our enegy portfolio increased utilization of our contractual obligationsto extend credit and weaker demand for energy lending. Such a decline or general uncertainty resulting from continued volatility could have other adverse mpats tht dffilto it r qantf,  f hich uld ha mtial arfft on us.l, to thexhat limat change and responses to climate change negatively impact the businesses and financial condition of our clients inthe energy industr, the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients may increase.

# 1 concentration in commercial real estate lending could cause our regulators to restrict our ability to grow.

As a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the \*CRE Concentrtion Guidance) with respect to a financial institutions concentrations in CRE lending activitie. Such guidance identifie cerain concentration leves that, if exceded, will expose an instittion to additional supervisory analysis The guidelines identify th following as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: i) the institutin's total construction, land development and other land loans represent $100 \%$ or more of total capital and reserves; or (ii) total CRE loans as defined in the guidance, or Regulatory CRE, represent $300 \%$ or more of the institution's total capital and reserves and the institution's Regulatory CRE has increased by $50 \%$ or more during the prior 36-month period. We believe that the CRE Concentration Guidance is applicable to us. Our CRE portfolio was $3 1 8 \%$ of total capital and reserves at December 31, 2022. The FDIC or other federal regulators may become concerned about our CRE loan porfolio and they could imit our ability to grow by retricting approvals of new branches and other growth opportunities or by requiring us to rase additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations or undertake other remedial actions.

# Many of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately $87 \%$ of our loan portfolio related to commercial-based lending. Commercial purpose loans are often lrr and inolve grate riks than ther type f lendng Rayment f thee loans ofen deends on the sucessfl opration o development f the property or business involved and are highly sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the industry in Which the business operates or the general economy. Accordingly, a downturn in the real estate market or other industry in which the business perates o the general economy could mpair he borowers aility to repay and heightens our risk related to commercil purpose loans, particularly CRE loans. osses incurred on a smal number f commercial purpose loans could have a materia dverse mpact on our financial condition and results of operations due to the larger-than-average size of each commercial purpose loan and collaeral that is generally less readily-marketable.

# Because a portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.

Adverse changes affecting real estate values or operating cash flows of real estate, particularly in the markets in which we operate, could incr te cdt risk ctd wth or n pofolio nd could ult i os th erly affctct qualit nd ur finil condition and eults of peration. Market value of real state can fluctate sgnificanly in a short period of time. Neative changes inthe economy affecting real estate values or operating cash flows in our market areas could significantly impair the value and marketability of property pledged loan collatral and may require us to increase our allowance for loan oses, any of whichcould have a materil adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.

# Our largest loan relationships make up a significant percentage of our total loan portfolio.

As of December 31, 2022, our 25 largest borrowing relationships totaled approximately $\$ 1.9$ billion in total commitments (representing, in the aggregate, $24 \%$ of our total outstanding commitments as of December 31, 2022). Our five largest borrowing relationships, based on total commitments, accounted for $9 \%$ of total commitments as of December 31, 2022. This concentration of borrowers may expose us to materil osse f one or more of theserelationships becomes delinquent or suffers default The allowance for loan loses may not be adequat to cover such loses and any lossor increase in the allowance would negatively ffec our eanings and capital. en if thee on are dequately colltalid, an ine  ssiied set could hm r reuttion th or relors and inhibit our ability to execute our business plan.

# A portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of participation and syndicated transaction interests, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to monitor the lending relationships and lead to an increased risk of loss.

As of December 31, 2022, we had \$68 million of purchased loan participations from other financial intutions and a combination of shared national credits and syndication interests purchased totaling $\$ 440$ million. Although we comply with our general underwriting criteria on these loan participations and syndicated loans, these ons may have a higher risk of los than loans we originate and admmistr. In such transactions in which we are not the lead lender, we rely in part on the lead lender or the agent, as the case may be, to monitor the performance of the loan and provide infomation that we use to classfy th loan and associated loan loss provisions. If our underwriting or monitoring of these loans is not sufficient, our non-performing loans may increase and our earnings may decrease.

# Our levels of non-performing assets could increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financia condition and could result in losses in the future.

As of December 31, 2022, our non-performing loans (which consist of non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and sil accruing interest and loans modified under troubled det restructrings that are not perfoming inaccordance with ther modified terms totaled \$12 million and our non-performing assets (which include non-performing loans plus other real estate owned) totaled $\$ 13$ million. However, we can give no assurance that our non-performing assts will continue o remain at thee levels and we may experience increase. in non-performing assets in the future. Non-performing assts adversely affect our management resources, net icome, isk profile and capital maintenance levels, efficiency ratio and returns on assets and equity, any of which may adversely affect us.

# Our allowance may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses on loans.

A significant source of risk arises from the possbilit that we could sustain osses due to loan defaults and non-performance on loans We maintai an allowance in accordance with GAAP to provide for such defaults and other non-performance. The amount of fure oses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates and inflationary or recesionary trends, many of which are beyond our control. We early adopted the Curent Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model on January 1, 2022; under CECL, we a required to use historica infomation, crrent conditions and reasonable forcasts o estimate the expected os over the life of the loan. Our underwriting policie, adherence to credit monitoring processes and risk management stems and controls may not prevent unexpected losses. Our llowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan loses. Moreover, any increase in our allowance wil adversely affect our net income and regulatory capital.

# We rely on our senior management team and may have difficulty identifying, attracting and retaining necessary personnel, which may divert resources and limit our ability to execute our business strategy and successfully grow our business.

Our continued growth and successful operation of our business depends, in large part, on our abilit to hire and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel at every level. Our senior management team has significant industry experience, and their knowledge and relationships would be dificlt to relacin the event f departure or retrement. We must also hire and retn qualified banking sonel to continue to grow our busines. Competition for killed personnel i the financial services and banking industry is ignificant and costs associated with incenting and retaining skilled personnel may be material and continue to increase If we are unable to hire and retan

ualified poel or sccesflly aes mangment scesion sse e may be unble to ucceslly exte our busins srategy nd manage our growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our busines, financial condition or results of operations.

# We rely on short-term funding, which can be adversely affected by local and general economic conditions.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately $\$ 5$ billion, or $8 3 \%$ , of our deposits consisted of demand, savings, money market and transaction accounts (including negotiable order of withdrawal accounts). The approximately $\$ 1$ billion remaining balance of deposits consisted of certificates of deposit, of which approximately $\$ 589$ million, or $10 \%$ of our total deposits, was due to mature within one year. Based on our experience, we belie that our sings, money market and non-intrst-baring acounts are relatively stable sources of fund. Our abilit to atrct nd maintin dosits, as well as our ost f funds, has een and will continue to be igficanly aected y general economic condtions. n addition, as markt interest rae ris, we will contie to hae comptitive presure to incrase the raes we pay on deposits. If we continue to increase interest rates paid to retain deposits, our earnings may be adversely affected.

# Our largest deposit relationships currently make up a significant percentage of our deposits and the withdrawal of deposits by our largest depositors could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources.

At December 31, 2022, our 25 largest depositors accounted for $2 5 \%$ of our total deposits and our five largest depositors accounted for $12 \%$ of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors or by one of our related client groups could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to meet business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and reults of operations. Such cirmstanes may require us raise desit ratesto atract ew deosits and ely more heavily on other funding sources that could be more expensive and lesstable. Under applicable regulations, if the Company was no longer wellcapitalized," we would be required to obtain FDIC approval toaccept brokered deposits and could also be subject to a deposit rate cap prohibiting us from paying in excess of 75 basis points above national deposit rates.

# Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and failure to maintain sufficient liquidity could materially adversely affect our growth, business, profitabilit and financial conditio.

Liquidity is essential to our business, sfficient levels of which are required to fund asset growth, serve client demand for loans, pay our debt obligations and meet other cash commtments. Liquidit ris is the potential that we will be unable to mee or obligations as they come due because of an inabilit to liquidate assts or obtain adequate funding without adverse conditions or consequences. Liquidit risk can increase due to a number of factors, including an over-reliance on a particular source f fundng, market-wide phenomena such as marke dislocation and major disasters and a high concentrtion of larg depositors. The Bank's primary funding source is client deposit. Other sources of funding may include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB"), the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (\*FRB") and our acuisition of bokered deposits, intt subsription certificat f deosit andeciprocal deposit through the Inri etwork Although the Bank has hsoricall een able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessar, t might not be able to replace such funds in the future. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, secrities and other sources could have a substantial negative effct on liquidit. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the lel or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse efect on our financial condition and results of operations and could impair our abilit to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.

# Ve may not be able to maintain sufficient capital in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity esults of operations and our ability to maintain regulatory compliance.

Our business strategy calls for continued growth. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our required regulatory capital levels. Our abilit to raise aditional capital deends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and gventl actvtie, our finncilondtion and perfane and comtion wth ther inncil inttions for capital sources. We canot guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capitl in the fure on acctabl terms, which may aderely affect our liquidity, growth strategy, financial condition and results of operations.

# Ve face strong competition from banks, credit unions, financial technology or Fintech companies and other financial ervices providers that offer banking services, which may limit our ability to attract and retain banking clients.

Competition in the banking industry generally, and in our primary markets specifically, is intense. Competitors include banks and ther financial srvices providers, such as savings and on instittions, brokerage fims, crdt unions, mortgge banks and ther finil intemedries. In particuar, we compet with ar natiol and reginal financil intitions, wose grate rources aford them many competitive advantage. Such resources may enable our competitors to achieve larger economies of scale; offer more services; spend more on advertising and technologial investments; offer beter eding rates t clients etter diversify ther loan portfolio, and have less unerability to dowtms in local eonomies and real estat markets. If we are unable to offer compettive proucts and servces as quickly as our larger competiors, our busines may be negatively ffected. We also compete against communit banks, credit unions and nonbank financial sries comanes with trong local ties to small and medum-si business tht we taet, and we may be unabl to ract and retain such clients as efetiely as thee smaller comptitors. ddtionally, we fa growing competion from so-callednine businees with few or no physical locations, including financial technology companie, oline banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms and automated retirement and investment ervice providers. New technology and other changes increasingly allow parties to effectat oin inncil rctions th itl to no nlvemen from banks, inludng bill aent, funs trnsfer n mntance of funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funs that would have historicl been held as bank deposits. The proces of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as "disintemediation," could reduce our income from fees and deposits. Ultimately, we may be unable to compete suceully against current and uure comtior, which may reuce ur revenue stram and prevent us from growing ur lon and deposit portfolios, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

# If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately $\$ 500$ million have been forgiven by the Small Business Administration, and we continued to hold PPP loans receivable of $\$ 3$ million. We have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the Small Business Administration that there is a deficiency in the manner in which a PP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, such as an issue wth the ligbility of a borrower to receivePP loan.

Additional regulation may be enacted in the future that could further impact our busines.

# We are subject to extensive regulation, which increases the cost and expense of compliance and could limit or restrict our activities, which in turn may adversely impact our earnings and ability to grow.

We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by a number of govenmental regulatory agencies, including, with respect to the Bank, the FDIC and the OSBCK and, with respect to the Company, the Federal Reserve. Regulations adopted by these gencies govem a comprehensive range of mattrs relatig to ownership and contro of our shares, our aquisition of ther companes and businses, pemissible activities for us to ngage in, mantnance of adequate capitl leels dividend payments and other aspect of our operations. Bank regulators posess broad authorit to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practice or vlations of aw. f a  eult f an xmition, a bankig agey demnes that n aspect of or opetions is unstiactry, or that we are, or our management is in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate.

Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Govenment policy, legislation and regulation, particularly monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, significantl affect economic growth and finncil opetions, incldig our disriution of credit, bank loans, inetments, deosits, prouct offrings and closures, interest rates and bankruptcy proceedings for consumer residential real etate mortgages. The laws and regulations aplicable to the banking industry could change at any time and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business, profitability or growth stratey. Increased relation could nse ur cost of compliance, verely affet proftbility and hit our bilit to condct busies consistent with historical performance. If we do not comply wth govenmental regulations, we may be suject to fines, penlties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our bsinesss and growth hat may damage our ruttion and verel affect our usiness opertions. Proposed legislative and reglatory actions may not ocur within expected time frames, or at all which cretes additional uncertainty for our business and industry. Accordingly, legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future could have a material advers impact on our busines, financial condition and results of operation.

# any of our expansion and growth plans require regulatory approvals and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.

As part of our growth strategy, we may expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions, adding branches and pursuin acquistions of ther complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive federal and state regulatory aproval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or rlated busines. In detemining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal and stte baking rs will considr, mng her facrs, thefet f the aqustion on mpttio, r finnc condtion, our future rospects and th impact of the proposal on .S. financial stability. The reulators aoeviw current and proect capita ratios, the competence, experience and interity of management and its record of compliance wth laws and reglations, the convenence and needs of the communities to be served and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities.

# The Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.

As a mattr of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to adequately commit resourcesto  subsidiary bank. Accordingly, we may be required to make capital injections into a troubled susidiay bank, even if uch conributio rtes a detimet t the mpany or its soklders. If we do not have sufficient reoures onhand to und the capital inection, we may be required to borrow funds orais capital. Any such loans are subordinat n right of payment to deposits and to certain indebtednessof te subsidiary bank. In the event of bankruptcy of the bank holding company, claims based upon any commitments to fund capital injections are entitled to a priority of payment over claims made by general unsecured creditors including holders of indebtedness. Thus, any borrowing incurred by the Company to make required capital injections to the Bank could adversely impact our financial condtion, results of operations and future prospects. Aditionally, under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA"), osses caused by a faiing bank subsidiary might be charged to the capital of an affiliate bank. Moreover, any bank operating under the Company's common control may alsobe required to contribute capital to a failig affiliate bank within the Company's control group. This is known as FIRREA's "cross-guaranee provision. The Company currently has one bank subsidiary.

# e Company and the Bank are subject to stringent capital requirements that may imit our operations and potential growt!

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements wil reult in crtin mandtry nddirtionary actions by relaors that, if undertaken, could have t material effect on our finncial

statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrctive action, the Company and the Bank must met peific capital gdelies that inolve quantitive mesures of or ats, liailities and in off-alace sh comtmnts as calculated under thee reulations. In order to be awllcaptalized depository istittion under prompt oretive action standards but without taking into account the capital conservation buffer requirement described below), a bank must maintain a CET risk-based capital ratio of $6 . 5 \%$ or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of $8 . 0 \%$ or more, a total risk-based capital ratio of $1 0 . 0 \%$ or more and a leverage ratio of $5 . 0 \%$ or more (and is not subject to any order or written directie specifying any higher capital ratio). The failure to meet the established capital requirements under the prompt corrective action framework could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities, ncluding our growth initiative or etricting the commenment of new activities and such falure could subject us to arity f eformnt rmedies avaable to the fedral elaory horities, including imting our bilit to pay dividends issuing a dective to incase our capital and tenating the Bank's FDIC deosit insurance, which iscitical to the continud pration of the Bank.

Including the capital conservation buffer requirement, the Company and the Bank must effctively maintain a CET1 capital ratiof $7 . 0 \%$ or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of $8 . 5 \%$ or more, a total risk-based capital ratio of $10 . 5 \%$ or more and, for the Bank, a leverage ratio of $5 . 0 \%$ or more and for the Company, a leverage ratio of $4 . 0 \%$ or more. Many factors affect the calculation of our risk-based assets and our abilit to maintain the level of capital required to acheve acctabl capital ratios, such as incase to our risk-weighted asets, loan mpairments, loan ses excdg the amount rerved for such oes and ther factrs tht dse our capital, thre dcing th el of the applicable ratios.

# Higher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.

Our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain deposit insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium asessments to the FDIC. Growth in inured dosits at FDIC-isured financi intitions in ret yr ausethe ratio of theIF to tol insured dosits to all below the current statutory minmum, and the FDIC has approved an increase in the base assessment raes to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum level by the statutory deadine. Although we cannot predict what the insurance assesment rates will be inhe fure, either adtiation in or rik-e caa tos or fther adustments to the ae amet rates culd hae a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

# Ve face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money aundering statutes and regulations.

The BSA, the PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an ffetive anti-money laundering program and to file reorts uch as uspicious activity rorts and urrency rsactionports. Violation of such requrements may result in significant cvil money penalties imposed by federal banking agencies and the U.S. Department of the Treasury' Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which agencies have recently engaged i coordinated enforement eforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ"), the Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with he rules enforced by the OFAC, which may require sanctions for dealing with certain persons or countries. If the policies, procedures and systems of our company, or any of our susidiarie, are emed defcient, we would be subject to fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and requirements to obtain relatory aprovals to proced with certain aspect f our business plan, inclding our acquistion plans. Failure to mantain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terorist financing could also have serious reutational consequences for us Any of these reults could have a material adverse efect on our business financia ondition, reults of oerations and growth prospects

# Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.

We are subject to various privacy, iformation security and data protection laws, including requirements concening security breach notification and we could be negatively mpacted by these laws. For example, our businessis subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our abilit to share non-public personal information about our clients with nonaffiliated third parties; ( requires that we provide certain diclosure to clients about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford clints the right toopt out of any infomation shring by us with non-afflia hrd parties (wth en ections), and (ii requires that we develop, implement and maintain witen comprehensive inomatio securit program contaning safeuard that are appropriate based on our size and complext, the nare and scope of our activities and the sensitivity f client infomation w proces, as well as plans for respondng todaa seurity breaches. Many sta and fedral banking reulators, states and foreig countre have also enacted datasecurity breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual,consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain cicumstances in the ent of securit breach. Moreover, leislators and regulators in the Unite States and other countries a irsigly adopting or rvising privacy, infomation surity and daa protection laws that potentilly ould have  ignficant mpact on our crrent ad planed privacy, t protion and infotio security-la pratie, our colltion, use, sharing, retention and safeuarding of client or mploye information and some of or current or planned usinessactivities his could also incrase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business ntiaties. This ncludes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level by the Federal Trade Commission, as wellas at the state level.

Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affcting client or employeedata to which we are subjec could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our abilit to proid cr pocts and rves, which could h maril refet on our busis, finncial condtions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially signficant rlatry or govmental inestigtions or actions, litigtio, fie anctions and damage to our reutation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

# Ve face increased risk under the terms of the CRA as we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets.

Under the terms of the CRA, each appropriat federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with it examination of a bank, to sess such bank's record in assessing and meeting the credit needs ofthe communities served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these examinations, the regulatory agency rates such bank's compliance with the CRA as "Outstanding," "Satisfactory," Needs to Improve" or "Substantial Noncompliance. The Bank had a CRA rating of "Satisfactory" as of its most recent CRA assessment. The regulatory agency's asesmentf an instittions rcord is part of the reulaory agencys consideration of applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or is holding company, or to open or relocate a branch office. As we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets, we wll be required to maintin an cceptable CRA rating, which may be difficult.

# We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.

The CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory ending requirements on financial inttions. The U.S. Deparment of Justice and ther federal agencies are reponsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A sucesful regulatory challenge to an instittio's performance under the CRA or fair lending aws and ltions culd ult i  wid vrity f tions, ildng dmge and ivil mone alie tie rlif, erictions on mergers and aqsitions activity, rtrctions on expansion and trctions oenting nw busiess ie.

Such actions could have a materil adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

# Risks Related to Our Common Stock

# The price of our common stock could be volatile.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subjecto wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are eyond our control. Thee factors include, mong ther things, ctal or anticipated varitions in our quarterly or annual reuls of oprations, rcommendations by seurities analysts prating pefmance or flucttions in th stock pric perfomance f ther companie that investors dem comparable to us, news reports relating to trends, concs and ther ssues in the financil services industry generally, conditions in the banking industry such as credit quality and monetary policies; domestic and intemational economic factors ulat toour peromance; prtions, geral markt conditions and, in partiua, deloments ladto markt conditio for the financil rves indstry, los of investor confidence n the mrket for stocks, n tchnology used, r services ffered,  competitors, loss of investor confidence and changes in govement reulations. f any of the foregoing occurs, t could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and be a distraction to management.

# Kansas law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and there are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.

Kansas corporate law and provisions of our artice of incorporation and our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third part to acquire us, eve if doing so would be perceived to be benficial by our stockholders. Furthemore, with certain limited exctions, federl regulations prhit a pron or ompany r group of prons demed to  actig in coert from, dirty r indtly, aui more than $10 \%$ - $5 \%$ if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the abilit to control in any manner the election of majority of our directors or herwise direct the management or policies of our ompany wthout prior notic or aplication to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements f applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of our common stock. Collectively, provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and other stattory and reulatory provisions may delay, prevent or deter a merger, aqusitio, tender offer proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving apremium over the market price for their common tock. Moreover, the mination of th prosions efftively iits crtin usins combnations, whch, in tm, culd verely afet the maket price yur common stock

# Future equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline.

We are generally not restricted from ssuing additional shares of tock, up to the 200,00o,00 shares of voting common stock and 5,00,0 hares of prefrred stock authorized in our articles f incorporation. We may isue additional shares of our common stock in the futre in various transctions, idg rnt to urren  e equ comption plans, uon coversions f prfrre tockr det upon exercise of warrants or in connection wth future acqusitions or financings. If we chose to ssue additional shares of our common stock, or surities convertibl ino share of our common stock, for any reason, the issuance would have adutive effct on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.

# We may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock.

Our articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,o,oo0 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the power to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, pees over our voting coon stock with ret toidends or in the event of a disoltion, liqudation or ining up and ther ms. f w issue prefred stock in the fure tht hs prfec over or con stock wth t  pyment f dividnds or upon our liquidtion, disoution or winding up, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

# Jur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions

Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally availabl for such payments. The Federal Rserve has indicated that bank holding companie should carefull review ther dividend policy in relation to the oranins vrllse qulity, crent and prosctive gs and capl eel, cotion and qlit. hemore, the Federal Reserve may prohibit payment of dividends that are deemed unsafe or unsound practice. Accordingly, any decaration and payment of dividends on our common stock will depend upon many factors, including our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requrements, the general economc and relaory climate, our abilit to service any equity r debt obligations senr to our common stock, our capital management policies and straegic plans; our growth initiatives; and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Any such factor could adverely affect the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our common stockholders. If declared, dividends wil be payable tothe holders of shares of our common stock on aro ra basis i accordnce wth their shares held. If preferre shares ae issued, such shares may be entitled to priority over the common shares as to dividends. Other than the stock dividend provided to our stockholders pursuant to our two-for-one stock split in 2018, we have no history of paying dividends to holders of our common stock.

# We are a bank holding company and our only source of cash, other than further isuances of securities, is distributions fron our wholly owned subsidiaries.

We are a bank holding company with no material activities other than activities incidental to holding the common stock of the Bank. Our principal source of funds to pay distributions n our common stock and service any f our obligations, other than further ssuances of securitie, would be dividend rived from our wholl wned subidiarie. Furthmore or wolly owed susidiarie re nt obligated to pay dividends to us and any dividends paid to us would depend on the eanings or financial condtion of our wholly owned subsidiaries and arius busisonsidrtions. As is the s withall inil instittions, th rtaity of our whll wd uidreis subect to the fluctating cost and avalability of money, changes in intrest rates and econmc conditions in general. I ddition, vrious fedral and state statutes limit the amount of dividends that our wholly owned subsidiaries may pay to the Company without regulatory approval.

# As an emerging growth company, or EGC, we utilize certain exemptions from disclosure requirements which could make our shares less attractive to investors and make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.

As an "emerging growth company", we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor atestation requirements of Section 404 of th Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. In addition, as an emerging growth company we are not required to comply with new or revise financial acounting standards unti private companies are required to comply and we have not opted out of this extended tantio peri. When  stndard is iued rid and t hs dff aplictionds for pulic r priat ompane, we can adopt the new or revised standard at he time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of the extendd anstion perod diffiut or mpossible ause of th pottial iffences in accounting standards used f some investors find or shares esatractive as a result f our reliance on these exmptions, the trading pries f our shares may be lower than they otherwise would be.

The Company modified the yield calculation on the AFS security portfolio to bettr conform to peer disclosures in the irst quarter of 2022.All eigasst yilds and net interest margins preented were rtroactively updated for the change in methodology. The following changes were made:

The average unrealized gain (los on AFS securities balance was removed from the security lines and placed in other non. interest earning assets

The annualization method was changed from Actual/Actual to 30/360 for the security yields

The Company believes the new calculation provides bettr insight into why the security yields and net interest margin change. period-to-period.

# Concentrations

As of December 31, 2022, the Company's top 25 largest borrowing relationships totaled aproximately \$1.9 billion in total commitments, representing, in the aggregate, $24 \%$ of our total outstanding commitments. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's top 25 deposit relationships represented approximately $2 5 \%$ , or $\$ 1.4$ billion, of total deposits. The majority of the \$1.4 billion are money market deposit accounts. The Company belies that there are sufficient funding sources, including on-balance shee lquid assets and wholesale deposit options, so that an immediat reduction in these deposit balances would not be expected to have a detrimental ffect on the Company's financial position or operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Company's ATM and credit card interchange income was driven by companies that mobilized their workforce directly impacted by the COvID-19 pandemic. These companies represented \$5 million or $61 \%$ of the \$8 million in ATM and credit card interchange income. This activity did not re-occur in 2022 at the same level.

# Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations

# Net Interest Income

Our profitabilit depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts recived on our intt-ing ass and th inest paid n our ntst-rig biltie. et ints iome is impacted y inal and external factors including:

Changes in the volume, rate, and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; Changes in competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies and economic conditions; and

Changes in credit quality.

We present and discuss net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis (FTE").

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we operated in an increasing interest rate environment. Our eaning assets repriced quicker than our cot f funds, reulting in a higher net ineest margin in 2022. During 2022 the Company benefite from changes in our deposit mix, including an increase in non-interest-bearing deposits that helped manage cost of funds.

Loan ines me e n f  \$14 mlio, 18 mllio a14 milin for the  dmer 31, 202 2021 and 20 etily. amounts.

Interest Income - Interest income increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The yield on eamng asset ireased 86basis points, led by an 85 basis pont increase in loan yied driven by the repricing of existing loans, rigination of new loans and the Centralacquisition. The yield on the investment portfolio also increased five basis points. Average earning assets increased $\$ 197.9$ million due to $\$ 262.9$ million higher average loans and an $\$ 82.5$ million increase in the average investment portfolio. The increased loan balances were due to strong loan growth, both organically and due to the acquisition of Central.

Interest Expense - Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022,compared to the same period in 2021. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased due to the higher interest rat environment and increased competition for deposits. The average volume for inteet-ig dit dli pmarl bse f rs i timet and ction it, partil ffe  nses in savings and money market deposits. Average FHLB and other borrowings declined compared to 2021; however, the rate paid on these borrowings remined consistent yer over year. The cost of funds increase was partill offse by an increse in average non-interest-bearing deposits from 2021 to 2022. We currently anticipate our cost of funds wil incrase in 2023 due tocontinued incrases in the inteest rate environment and competition for deposits.

Net Interest Income -- Full year 2022 net interest income grew $\$ 24.8$ million, an increase of $1 5 \%$ compared to 2021. Full year net interest income - FTE grew $\$ 25.1$ million, an increase of $1 5 \%$ compared to 2021, while the net interest margin ("NIM") - FTE increased to $3 . 5 0 \%$ from $3 . 1 7 \%$ in the prior year due to the higher interest rate environment as well as the mix shift from cash into higher eaning asets as noted above. The NIM - FTE also benefited from a $31 \%$ increase in non-interest-bearing deposits which benefited the NIM-FTE 4 basis points. We currently expct the net interest margin to remai flat o slighly increae in 2023 as we currentl anticipate a slowdown in the trajectory of interest rate increases. We currently anticipate that competion for deposits wil continue into 2023 as clients seek higher yields.

The changes in non-interest income were driven by the following:

Service charges and fee on customer accounts - This category includes account analys fee offset by acustomer rebate program. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by a decline in costs associated with our rebate program. In addition, customer growth and an increase in outstanding balances improved account analysis fees.

Realized gains on available-for-sale ecurities  The Cmpany ells AFS secrities or stratic reasons including captalizing on atractive market ondtions, mproing the credit qulity of th serty portfolio, o for x puroses primarly to ft captl oses. The realized gains on AFS securities declined from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to the Company selling securities for tax purposes and to capitalize on attractive market conditions in 2021.

Gains (losses), net on equity securitie - During 2021, the Company recorded a\$6 mllon loss elaed to an equity investment rceived as part of a modified loan agreement in 2020. The Company electe to account for this security at cost ess impairment, unles an orderly transactio for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer occured that would result in an update far market value. During 2021 significant adverse changes in market conditions for the investment resulted in the investment being sold below its book value. Refer to the "Equity Securities" section in Note 3: Securities within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Income from bank-owned life insurance - The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the Compar recognizing \$2 million in tax-free death benefits from a bank-owned life insurance policy in 2021 that did not re-occur in 2022.

ATM and credit card interchange income - The decrease in ATM and credit card interchange income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of one large customer that mobilized their workforce directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and into 2021. This activity did not re-occur in 2022 and accounts for the lower income.

Non-interest expense to average assets

Non-interest expense increased $\$ 22.4$ million and included $\$ 4.2$ million of transaction costs and core deposit intangible amortization related to the Central acquisition. In addition, the Central acquisition added approximately $\$ 1.7$ million of non-interest expense, the majority in the salary and employe benefits line as we added employeesto our teams. The ratio of non-inerest expense to average aets increased to $2 . 1 1 \%$ , in part, due to the Central acquisition as wellas increased costs as we continue to invest in new markets, technology, and personnel. The changes in non-interest expense were driven by the following:

Salary and Employee Benefits - Salary and employee enefit costs increased due to new market expansion, anual merit increases, the addition of employees as part of the Central acquisition and increased performance-based incentive compensation.

Occupancy - Occupancy costs increased due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\*ASC) 842, Leases on January 1, 2022 as wellas a new lease in our Dallas market resulting from expansion. We currently expect occupancy costs to increase in 2023 related to our expansion into the Fort Worth, TX market and may increase further as we enter new markets in the future.

Professional Fees - Professional fees increased due to $\$ 1.4$ million related to the Central Bank acquisition, $\$ 0.3$ million in lending relate legal fees and $\$ 0.1$ million due to recruiting fees.

Data Processing - Data processing expense increased due to the Central acquisition, acount growth and costs related to our dgital banking conversion.

Advertising - The increase in advertising costs was driven by increased post-pandemic activities.

Software and Communication - The increase was driven by our continued investment i best-in-classtechnologies. I addtion to the growing number of technologies implemented, a portion of the increase in costs was due to our growth.

Foreclosed Assets, net - The decrease in foreclosed assets, net was due to the Company sellig a foreclosed commercial use facilit during 2021 at a loss.

Other non-interest expense - The increase was due to employee separation expense of $\$ 1.1$ million and higher travel and entertainmen costs in 2022 due to an increase in post-pandemic activities.

Our GAAP efficiency ratio for 2022 was $5 7 . 7 5 \%$ and our adjusted efficiency ratio - FTE was $54 . 4 3 \%$ . See below under "NonGAAP Financia Measures" for a reconciliation. We currently expect to manage the eficiency ratio lower through 2023 as we finish the integration of Central and scale investments in new markets.

# Income Taxes

Our income tax expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primaril from investments in tax antgd aets, such as bank-wned life insurae and tax-expt munipal srities stte tax credts and pemanent tax differences from equity-based compensation. In addition, 202 included a \$0.3 mllion charge related to certain non-deductible

The tax-exempt benefit diminishes as the Company's ratio of taxable income to tax-exempt income increases. We currently anticipate the effective tax rate to remain in the range of $20 \%$ to $22 \%$ for 2023. A three-year trend of our income tax and effective tax rate is presented below:

# Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to disclosing financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures including \*tangible common stockholders equity, \*tangible book value per share, "djusted eficiency ratio - FTE, "adusted net income, adjusted diluted eaings per share, djusted return on average asses, and "adjusted return on average common equity." We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or gains that we belie are t indctive f r pimry sinsserti eults. We belie that mangment and iestrs benfit fom referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in asessing our performance and when planing, forecasting, analyzing and comparig past, present and future periods.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and you should not rly on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our prformance. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differfrom non-GAAP financial measures used by our prs or other companies. We compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent GAAP measures whenever we present the non-GAAP financial measures and by including areconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non-GAAP financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures follows.

# Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition

# Loan Portfolio

At December 31, 2022, our loan porfolio was comprised of new loans that we have originated and loans that were acquired on November 22, 2022 in the acquisition of Cenral. Certain of the comparative graphs below are excluding the Cenral loans and are so noted

Loans represent our largest portion of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other assets. The quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when reviewing our financialcondition. We established an internal loan policy that outlines a standard lending philosophy and provides consistent direction to achieve goals and objectives, which include maximizing earnings over the short and long term by managing risks through the policy. Intemal concentrtion limits exist on all loans, including commercia relestate, eergy, and land deelopment. We established strong underwriting practices and proceures to asess ur borrowers, including review of det service, collaeral value and evaluation of guarantors. We also engage thrd-parties to independently review our loan portfolio. Appropriate actions are taken when a borrower is no longer able to service its debt.

Our loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, primarily made up of commercial and industrial and commercial real etate loans Commercial and industril loans are generally paid back through normal business operations. Commercial real estate loans, which include both construction and limited term financing are typicall paid back through normal income from operations, the sale ofthe underlying property or refinancing by other instittional sources. Most of our loans are made to borrowers within the taes we operate, which include Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arizona, Txas, Colorado and New Mexico. In addition, we occasionall inest in syndicated shared nationl credits and loan participations.

# Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses ("ACL")

The Company implemented the CECL model as of January 1, 2022. Refer to Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details regading the transition, ncluding the impact tothe financial statements. The CECL model compared to the incurred loss modl may accelrate the provision for credit oses if the Compan's loan portfoliocontinues to grow. In adtion, positiv (ngative) forwardlooking indicators may decrease (increase) the required provision for credit losses.

The ACL at December 31, 2022 represents our bes estimate f the expected credit loses in the Company's loan portfolio and off balance sheet commitments, measured over the contractual life of the underlying instrument.

Upon adoption of the CECL model, the Company established a reserve for unfunded commitments (\*RUC") and reduced the ACL $\$ 1.7$ million as of January 1, 2022. During 2022, the ACL increased by $\$ 3.4$ million due to $\$ 4.6$ million in Central Day 1 CECL provision on non-PCD loans and a $\$ 0.9$ million Central Day 1 provision on PCD loans. In addition, the ACL grew $\$ 12.8$ million due to loan growth and changes in credit quality and economic factors. These increases were partiall offset by the day 1 impact of CECL adoption noted above of $\$ 1.7$ million, $\$ 3.8$ million in net charge-offs, and a reduction in reserves on impaired loans of $\$ 9.4$ million.

Credit quality metrics were significantly improved compared to the prior year. Non-performing assets decreased to $\$ 13.2$ million at December 31, 2022 entirely due to a $\$ 20.2$ million decrease in non-accrual loans. The decline is attributable primarily to payments and payoffs on non-accrual energ, commercial and indusrial and commercial real estate loans during the year. The non-performing assets to total assets ratio decreased to $0 . 2 0 \%$ at December 31, 2022 from $0 . 5 8 \%$ at December 31, 2021. Classified loans decreased $\$ 11.2$ million during the year but included the addition of $\$ 5.7$ million from Central. Without Central, classified assets decreased $\$ 16.9$ million due to reductions in classfied energy, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. Loans 30-89 days past due increased $\$ 16.0$ million primarily due to administrative past dues which were short-term in nature.

# Investment Portfolio

Our investment portfolio is govemed by our investment policy that sets our objectives, limits and liquidity requirements among other items. The porfolio is mantained to serve s a continget, on-balance set source of liquidty. The objective of our inestment porfolio is to optimize earnings, manage credit risk, ensure adequate liquidity, manage interest rate risk, meet pledging requirements and meet regulatory capital requirements. Our investment portfolio is generally comprise of govemment sponsored entity secrities and U.. tate and political subdivision securities with limits set on all types of securities.

At the date of purchase all debt securities are classified as AFS securities. Since interest rates move in cycles, having an AFS portfolio llows managment to: ) proect againt adtional nealized market valation loss; () provide more liquidity as rates rise, which often coincides with incrasing loan demand and slower deposit growth, an (ii) generate more money to reinvest when rates are higher giving th instittion an opportunty to lock in higher yield. In th event the AFS porfolio beomes too large given the constrants set inthe policy, investments may be classfied as held-to-matrity. Heldto-maturit cassfication wil only be used if we have the intent and ability to hold the investment to its maturity.

At December 31, 2022, AFS debt securities decreased $\$ 59$ million or $8 \%$ from the prior year-end primarily due to the $\$ 112$ million increase in unrealized losses. During 2022, the Company purchased $\$ 50$ million of tax-exempt municipal securities, \$48 million of mortgagebacked securities, $\$ 10$ million of SBA, and \$6 million of corporate securities. During 2021, the Company purchased $\$ 117$ million of taxexempt municipal securities and $\$ 108$ million of mortgage-backed securities primarily to deploy liquidity into higher yielding interestearning assets.

For information related to the book value and fair value of our AFS securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 refer to the \*Available. for-Sale Securities" segment in Note 3: Securities within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial tatements. For information related to the investment maturit schedule and weighted average yield for each range of maturities refer to the Maturity Schedule sement in Note 3: Securities within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

# Bank-Owned Life Insurance

The Company maintains investments in BOLI policies to help control employee benefit costs, as a protection against loss of certain employees and as a tax planning strategy. The decrease in yield during 2022 was primarily due to the Company recognizing $\$ 2$ million in tax-free eath befits from a BOL policy in 2021, coupled with movements in the insurance carrier's underlying inestments and operating costs that decreased the overall income on the underlying asset.

The following table provides the balance of BOLI income eamed and tax-equivalent yield for the periods indicated:

At December 31, 2022, deposits increased $\$ 968$ million, or $21 \%$ , from the prior year-end including $\$ 570$ million from the Central acquisition. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased \$237 million or $20 \%$ from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, including $\$ 225$ million from the Central acquisition. The increase in non-interest-bearing deposits was driven by approximately $\$ 544$ million of increased deposits from current clients and approximately $\$ 189$ million from new deposit relationships and $\$ 225$ million from Central, partially offset by deposit withdrawals. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, non-interest-bearing deposits represented $2 5 \%$ of total deposits. Transaction deposits and savings and money market deposits increased $\$ 409$ million at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, as a result of new deposit relationships, increased deposits from current clients and the acquisition of Central. Time deposits increased by $\$ 321$ million during 2022. Approximately $\$ 489$ million of time deposits matured in 2022, offset by $\$ 829$ million of new and renewed time deposits. Brokered time deposits increased during 2022 to meet short-term liquidity needs.

# Other Borrowed Funds

Since it may not be possible to achieve the institution's overall funding needs through core deposit funding, other borrowings may be used to suppor ase growth. The ris ssociated wth the brrowings are addressd in the same ahion as ther inanci condtion risks incurred by the Bank. Credit risk, interest rate risk,concentrtion risk, capital adequacy and liquidity are measured for the consolidated statement of financial condition as a whole, including any wholeale funding strategies that have ben implemented or are expected to be implemented.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company is subject to contrctual obligations made in the ordinary course of busines. The obligations include deposit liabilities, other borrowed funds, and operating leases. Refer to Note 1: Borrowing Arrangements within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for alistig of our Dember 31, 202 signficant contractual cash oligations to third partie n debt oligations. Refer to Note 6: Leases within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial tatements for a summary of our contractual cash obligations to third parties on lease obligations.

As a financial services provider, the Company is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit. Off-balance seet arrangements represet the Company's future cash requirements. However,a portion of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Refer to Note 21: Commitments and Credit Risk within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a listing of our December 31, 2022 off-balance sheet arrangements.

The Company's short-term and long-term contractual obligations, including off-balance shet obligations, may be satisfied through ur on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity discussed below.

# Liquidity

Liquidity is the abilit to generate adequate amounts of cash from depositors, stockholders, profits or other funding sources, to me! ur needs for funding, including payments to borrowers, operational costs,capital requirements and other strategic cash flow needs.

Our liquidity policy govens our approach to our liquidity position. The objective isto maintain adequate, but not excessive, liquidity to mee the daily cash flow neds of our clients whil attempting to acheve adequate earnings for or stockholders. Our iquidity position is monitored continuously by our finance department.

Liquidity resources can be derived from two sources: (i) on-balance sheet liquidity resources, which represent funds currently on the consolidae statment f financi ondtion, and  off-alane she iquty eores, which rereent funds aailable from third-party sources. On-balance het liquidit rource include oveght funds, short-tem deposits wth other banks, AFS serities, and certi ther sources. Off-balance sheet liquidity resources consist of credit lines, wholesale deposits and debt funding and certain other sources.

On-balance shet iquidity resources can be broken down into thre sections: i) primary liquidity resources, which represent liquid funds that are on the cosoldatd stmnt f financiondion,  ertiry liqty eource, which ret sts that can be sold into the secondary market, and (ii) ublic fuds, which represent deposits. Primary liquidit reources include ovemight funds plus short term, interst-bring deosits with ther banks and unplged AFS seurities. Tertiry liquidt resources iclude loans that can be sold int the secondary markt or through participation and unpledged securitie classfied as held-to-maturity. Public funds are another source of wholesale deposits as they require collateral.

Off-balance sheet liquidity resources require sufficient collateral, in the fom of loans or securitie, and have lager, negative impac on our capit ratio. As a result, ff-balance set liquidty has a higher ost on our aset growth compared o deosit growth. ff-balane shee iquidity exists in several forms inluding: ) intemet subscription certificates f deposit; () brokered deposits; (i) borrowing capacity; (iv) repurchase agreements; or (v) other sources.

Internet subscription certificates of deposit are deposits made through national, wholesale certificates of deposit funding programs. These programs are designed to provide funding outside of the Bank's normal market or existing client base and allow the Bank to diversify its wholeale fuding eures. This fo of funding do ot require olaral and gnly cannt e eemed early. Brokrddeposits are deposits funded through various broker-dealer rlationships. The market for wholeale deposits is well developed. A key featue ofthis type of funding is that it is generally unsecured and does not require collateral for pledging.

Borrowing capacity refers to a form of liaility-based funding. Repurchase agreements are another source of short-term funding n Which a bank agre to sell asecurity to a counterparty and reurchas the same or an identical scurity from the counterparty at a specified future date and price. Public funds are another source of wholesale deposits as they require collateral.

Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan portfolio and security portfolio increases i client deposits and wholeale deposits. Other altemative sources of funds wil supplment these primary source to the extet neary to met addtional liquidity requirements on ether hortterm or lon i. The y l tt its t iqty nd as uch lti srffuds will  sficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months and thereafter.

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $\$ 300$ million compared to \$483 million at December 31, 2021. The change in cash and cash equivalents was due to an $\$ 80$ million increase in cash provided by operating activities, a $\$ 620$ million decrease in cash provided by investing activities primarily due to strong loan growth and net cash provided by financing activities of $\$ 357$ million primarily due to increases in time deposits. During 2022, liquid assets decreased as loan growth outpaced deposit growth. The decrease was partially offset by net cash activity from the Central acquisition of $\$ 126$ million.

As of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had the following available funding:

On-balance sheet liquidity(1l) Off-balance sheet liquidity(2) Total liquidity

On-balance sheet liquidity(l) as a percent of assets Total liquidity as a percent of assets

# Capital Requirements

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minm caital requiremnts can intiate eran mandry and possibly addtional discrtionary ctions by relars that if undertaken, could hae a diect materia effect on the Cmpanys conslidated financial statement. Refer to Item 1. Busies under the "Supervision and Regulation" section for a detailed discussion regarding our capital requirements.

Refer to Note 14: Regulatory Maters in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the table that summarizes the capital requirements applicable tothe Company and the Bank in order to be considered well-capitalized from a regulatory prspective, as well as the Company's and the Bank's capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Base II and the Bank was considered to be \*well-capitalized" for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

# Stockholders' Equity

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's stockholders' equity decreased primarily due to changes to the unrealized los n AFS securities, the impact of Central and share repurchases, partially offset by an increase in net income.

Changes in stockholders' equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 are provided in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Additional information regarding the Company's stock activity is provided in Note 19: Stockholders Equity within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

# Interest Rate Sensitivity

A primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Managing interest rate risk is a key element of our consolidated statement f financial ondtion managment. Intest rate riskis the risk that net intest margins will be eroded over time dueto changing market conditios. Many factors can cause margins to erod including, without limitation, () lower loan demand; () ncrased competition for funds; (i) wak pricing polies; (iv)statement f financial condition mimatches; and () hanging liqudity demands. We manage our sensitivity ptio in aode wth or int ra risk olicy. he magme f nest rat ik is a thrst proc d les: (i) measuring the interest rate risk position; (ii) policy constraints; and (ii) strategic review and implementation.

Our exposure to nterest rate risk is managed by the Bank's Asset/Liability Commitee (\*ALCO') in accordance with policies approved by the Bank's board of directors. ALCO uses a combination of thre systems to measure the statement f financial conditin's interest rate risk position. Because each system seres a different purpose and provides a different perspective, the the systems in combination ae expected  rovid a bter overall ul hn  singl system alone. The th sts iclude: gap rports; ) earnings simulation; and (iii) economic value of equity (EVE").

A gap report measures the repricing volume of assets and liabilities by time period. The difference between repricing asses and repricing liabilities for a particular time period is known as the periodic repricing gap. Using this method t is possiblto estimate the impact on eanings of a given rate change. As a method of evaluating interest rate risk, the gap report i a reasonably accurate method of aseing earnings exposure. However, it reliability diminishes as statement of financial condition complexity increases. Optionality and other factors complicate the analysis.   
An eamings simulation measures the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income and earnings. Earnings simulation is more detailed than gap analysis. Under this approach, the repricing characteristics of each asset and liability instrument are programmed into a computer simulation model. This programming allows the Bank to refine important characteristics such as caps, floors, and time lag. It also allows the Bank to include the impact of new business activity in the analysis. Gap reporting only considers the existing statement of financial condition position.   
EVE is a valuation approach to measuring long-term interest rate risk exposure. This approach considers ll future time periods, which provides an advantage over eanings simulation. However, anegative attribute f EVE is that t assumes a sustained change in rates, which is never the case in the long-term. This seeks to compute the financial risk of having a duration mismatch between assets and funding.

In addition, ALCO compares the current inerest rate risk position to policy limits. This procedure is compliance oriented and results in eithr a passor fal outome. hen he staten of financl condtion is in compliance  further ationi sry. In instanes of noncomplince, ALCO will develop a plan of action to correct the conditin. A summar of the plan and its timing for completion will be forwarded to the board of directors each quarter until compliance is reestablished.

ALCO also evaluates interest rate risk positioning in light of anticipated interest rates. The purpose of this comparison i to determine whether action stes nd to be taken to modify currnt strategy. The reults form a decision-making input for ALC. Ifi is dtmind tha more as i s  wllt  ie    ivea.ite ll f less asset sensitivity is desired.

Loan and deposit repricing assumptions are critical in measuring interest rate risk. For loans, management reviews spreads and prepayment assumptions. For deposits, management reviews beta factors and decay assumptions. ALCO reviews and adjusts repricing assumptions at least annually. Model assumptions are included in the output reports and reviewed by ALCO on a periodic basis.

When evaluating statement of financial condition rate sensitivity, a proper analysis of total funding is of critical importance. The funding side of the statement of financial condition can be segregated into three broad categories as fllows: (i) funding with defined maturity dates; (ii) non-maturity deposits; and (ii) perpetual funding.

Funding with defined maturity dates includes certificates of deposit and borrowed funds. The repricing analysis requires a twofold statement of behavior for each statement of financial condition category. It requires a cash flow schedule for principal and interest payments and a repricing schedule of rate adjustments. Once the cash flow and repricing projections are developed, the category car be analyzed for interest rate risk exposure.

Non-maturity deposits tend to be a longer term, less volatile source f funds. Non-maturity deposits have very short contractual lives. The Bank uses historical analysis to develop its decay assumptions, but it looks at aggregate account types rather than individual clients. The review analyzes both non-maturity deposits as a whole and individual deposit categories. Perpetual funding is the most stable and least costly source of funding. Its main component is equity capital. It has a zero interest rate and cannot be withdrawn by stockholders because of a rate change. In effect, it is a perpetual source of free funding.

Periodic independent evaluations are conducted and documented. Each evaluation consists primarily of: (i) an assessment of internal controls i) an ealuation of data interity, ) the apropriateness f the rik managment system iv the sonablenessf validity scenarios; () a review of AOs charter, and (i) validatio of calulations. In adition, to esure the model is working as expected a back test of the model is completed at least annually.

All of the assumptions used in our analysis are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net intrest ime r pry prt th mpac fflcti in mark in rnnt in imet relts my differ fro the model's simulated reuts due to timing, magntude and frquency of intest rate change as well a changes in markt conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.

On a quarterly basis, we run various simulation models including a static statement of financial condition and dynamic growth statement of financial condition. hese models test the impact on net intrest income and far value of uity from hanges in markt inerest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model and dynamic growth model, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rates change over a 12-month horizon based upon paralle and nonparallel yield curve shifts arallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield urve scenario. Nonparall simulation involves analys of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve.

Our intenal policy regarding intemal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parall shiftsof the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than $10 \%$ for a $- 2 0 0$ basis point shift, $1 5 \%$ for a $- 3 0 0$ basis point shift, $5 \%$ for a -100 basis point shift, $5 \%$ for a 100 basis point shift, $10 \%$ for a 200 basis point shift, and $1 5 \%$ for a 300 basis point shift.

The Company has several instruments that can be used to manage interest rate risk, including: () modifying the duration of interestbearing iaitie; ) mding thertio f it-ngst, ilng ur me io nd (i enig into on-alane sheet derivatives. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk.

ALCO evaluates interes rate risk using a rate shock method and rate ramp method In a rate shock analysis, rates change immediately and the change is sustained over the time horizon. In a rate ramp analysis, rate changes occur gradually over time. The following tables summarize the simulated changes in net inteest income and far value of equity over a 12-month horizon using a rate shock and rate amp method as of the dates indicated:

# Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and with general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex nd subjective estimates and assumptions that afect the mounts reported in the financia statements and accompanying notes. We base our estmates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basi for our judgments about the carrying ls f ass and bilties tht ae nt redy aibl from indendet, oective sources. We alte our etimates on an ongoing bas.se of alteative amptions may haeeultd i inificanly differen stimtes. Atal rults may diffe from these estimates.

The Company qualifie as an EGC under the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period when complying with new or revised accounting standards. This llows an EGC to delay adoption of certan accounting standards unil those standards would apply toprivatecompanies; however, the EGC can stillearly adopt new or revised accounting standards, if aplicable. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means the financial statements in this Form 10-K, as well s financil statments we fil in the future, will be subect to ll new or reied accounting standards generally applicable o private companies, unles stated thrwise. This decision will emain in efect until the Cmpany loses ts EGC status.

Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We identified the following accounting policies and etimates that e to the diffilt, sujective r complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potntial sensitivity of our financial statements to those jugments and assumptios, ae critical to an understanding of or financil condtion and reults of opeations.

# Allowance for Credit Losses

The determination of the ACL, which represents managements estimate of expected lifetime credit lossis recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset, including those aquired hrough a busines combination, which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the aset. The calculation of expected credit loses includes consideration of past events, current conditions, and rasonable and suprl onomic fsts that affct thelit f the ted mounts. Gnerall, exptd rit loes are detind hough a pooled, collctive asent f lns and ls wit simir risk hractrsics. Hwer, if the risk charteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of thecollctively asessed pol, it is removed from the population and individually asessed for credit losses. The total ACL on loans and leaes recorded by management rpresents the aggregate estmated credit los deerined through both the collective and individual asessments. See Note 4: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Although managment belies the lels of the allowance for credit osses at December 31, 2022are adequate to absorb expected credt losse, if actal results are materialy different from the judgments and uncertainties made, the Company would be required to increase (decrease) its credit losses provision resulting in a decrease (increase) in net income.

# Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all liquid investments with original maturities of three months or les to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2022 cash equivalents consisted primarily of both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing accounts with other banks. Approximately $\$ 273$ million of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City at December 31, 2022. The Company is required to maintain reserve funds in cash and/or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank. The reserve required at Dember 31, 2022 was \$0. In addtion, the Company is required from time to time to place cash collateal with third parties as part ofit back-to-back swap agreements and cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2022, no cash collateral was required. At December 31, 2022, the Company's cash accounts, excluding funds at the Federal Reserve Bank and funds required as cash collateral. exceeded federally insured limits by $\$ 9$ million.

Securities - Debt secrities for which the Company has no immediate plan to sell but which may be sold in the future, are classfied as available-for-sale (AFS) and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and loses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive (los) income. Purchase premiums and discounts are rcognized in interest income using the intest method over the terms f the securities. Gains and osses on the sale of debt securities are recorded on the trade date and are detemined using the specific identification method.

Equity securities are recorded at far value with unrealized gains and losses included in eamings. Gains and losses on the sale of equity securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method.

The Company elected a measurement altemative for three private equity investments that did not have readily determinable fair value and did not qualify for the practical expedient to tmate fair value using the net asse lue er share A cost basis was clulat the equity investments. The recorded balance will adjust for any impaiment or any observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

For AFS securities in an unrealized losposition, the ompany first asesses whether it intends to sel, or it is more likely than not that it will be rquito el the rit bor covey f is rti cost bs. f ethr fth i d in  irement to sell is met the ecurities amortized cost basis is witen downto far value through income. For AF scurities that do not meet the criteria above, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit loses or ther factors. Management considers the xtent to which far value is les than amortied cost, any change to the rating of the seurity by rating gency, and adverse condtios sfilly o th rty, g t fars. f this aet inca tht a cr s s, the  ale of ash flows expected to be clected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the scurit. fthe present value of cash flows expt llc s es thn he arti cost si  rt os xists and n lowance f cit o s rodd for te credit loss liited by the amount that the fair vlue is es than amortid cost basis.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, declines in the fair value of AFS securities below their cost that were deemed to be otherthan-temporarily impaired wre reflected in enings as realized loses. In estmating other-than-temporary-mpaiment prior to January 1, 2020, the Cmpany considered, among ther hings, the severity and duration of the unrealizd os position, adverse conditions sificaly related to the security; changes in expected futur cash flows; downgrades in the rating of th security by a rating gency, the failur of the issuer to make scheduled intes or principal payments, whether the Company had the intent to sel the security, and whether i was more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security.

Loans - Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstading pricipal alances justed for unamed nome, chage-off, the allowance for lon los ay unmortizd deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans.

For loans amortized at cost, interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net f certan drect orition cost, as wel as pmiums andcounts, are errd and amortized as a level yed adustment over the rtie tem f the loan.

The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued a the time the oan is 90 days past due unles the credit is well seurd nd n pro f cllection  d is conid wel sr ifi is surd  coll in the fom of lies or pledges of real or peronalopert, iritie, tht hlizbl lue sufficnt tochrge thedt g ar ntt)n ul or i rd  he  f  i se . dt  in the  f clltif ti f the t is preng n due course ether though lal action, inludng enforment procdure or i apropriat iumstances through collectin effors not ivolving ll action which a sonably expt to reult i ment f the det r in it totion o a urrent stus. Past de staus is based on conractl tes of the oan. In all cases, loas are lac on non-accrual or charged off at an rlier date, if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.

All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged f are reversed against interest income. The interest on thee loans i accounted for on the cah basis or cost recovery method, until qualifying for retum to accrual. When payment are received on non-accrual oans, payments are applied to principal unless there is a clear indication that the qualit of the loan has mproved to the point that it can be placed back on accral status. oans are rturned toaccrual status when al th principal and inerest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

Allowance for Credit Losses ("ACL) - The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instrments, ffective Jnuary 1, 2022The Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model requires an estimate of expected credt osses, measured over the contractual if of a instrment, that considers forasts of fuure economic condtions in addition to infomation about past events and current conditions.

The Company uses a los-rate ("cohort") method to estimate the expected allowance for credit loses ("ACL") for all loan pools. The cohort method identifies and captures the balance of a pool of loans with similar risk characteristics, as of a particular point in time to fom a cohort, then traks the reptive lo ed  tht cohot of lns er ther mag lives, r until th ls are hauste (i.e., have reached an acceptable point in time at which a signficant majorit of all osses are expected to have ben recognized). The Company has elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the ACL process, because atimely write-off policy exists.

# Unfunded loan commitments

In addition to the ACL for funded loans, the Company maintains reserves to cover the risk of oss associated with off-balance sheet nfunded loan commments. he alowance for off-balane sheet crdit los is mainaind within the other labilities in the statements of financial conditio. Under the CEC framework austments tothis liailit are rcorded as provision for credit loses in the statements of operations. Unfunded loan commitment balances are evaluated by loan class and further segregated by revolving and non-revolving commitments. In order to establish the required level of reserve, the Company applies average historical utilization rates and ACL loan model loss rates for each loan class to the outstanding unfunded commitment balances.

Refer to Note 4: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information regarding the policie, procedures, and credit quality indicators used by the Company.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company's determination of the allowance tok into consideration, among other matters periodic rvi f the abilit oollct ns in light f hsrical expriece, thee and olme fthn ofolio, ae sations that may ffect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collteral and prevaling economic conditions.

Under the prior incurred loss methodology, the Company routinely evaluated adversely risk-rated credits for impairment. Impairment, f any, was typicall measured for each loan by either (i) the prent value fth lons expecte futur cah flows discounted at the loan's effctive inteest rate  he lns otanable market price or () the estmatd fa vale f the clltrl, if th an was collaeal dendet. General allowances wre etablished for loans with simiar charactrisic. In this procs, gneal alowance factors were based on an analysis of historical loss experience and expected loss iven default derived from the Company's internal risk rating process. Othr dstments my hae emade afr asing inl r extl e n redit qality that w t full rflected in the historical los or risk rating data. To the extent that the data supporting such factors had limitations, management's judgment and experience played a key role in determining the allowance estimates.

Premises and Equipment - With the exception of premises and equipment acquired through business combinations, which are initially meued d ecordd  fi alue, deiable aes are state at cost es acculated drciation. Dreciation is chrgd to expense using th straight-line method over the estimated useful lie ofth assets. Leasehold mprovements are capitalized and depreciated using the straght-ine method over the tems of th repective les or the estimatd usefl lives f th improvments, whicher is shorter. Expected terms include lease option perios to the extent that the exercise of such options is reasonably assured. The Company generally assigns depreciable lives of 35 to 40 years for buldings and improvements, 5 to 7 years for funiture and fixtures and 3 to 5 years for equipment. The Company reviews premises and equipment whenever ents or changes in circumstaces indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment lossis recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expectd to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than its carrying amount.

Restricted Equity Securities - Restricted equity securities include investments in FHLB Topeka and Bankers' Bank of Kansas. FHLB Topeka is a Federal Home Loan Bank and is stock is arequired investment for intutions that are members of the Federal Home Loan System. The required investment in the common stockis based on a predetermined formula. The Bankers' Bank of Kansas is a correspondent bank located in Wichita, Kansas and the investment is carried at cost and evaluated for impairment.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance - The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key employees that are acounted for under the fair value method. Bank-owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the statement of financial condition date, which is the cash surrender value. Changes i cash surrender value are recorded in eamings in the period in which the changes occur.

Foreclosed Assets Held-for-Sal - Assets acquired through, or i lieu of, loan foreclosure are held-for-sale and are intially recorded at fair vle  cot sellt th dte f forlosure, lishing a nw cost basi. uquent o fosure, ltions re rdaly performed by management and the aets ar carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value les cost to sell Reveue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net income or expenses from foreclosed assets.

Goodwill and intangible assets, net - Goodwill is established and recorded if the consideration given during an acquisition transaction exceds th far vle of th et ats reeivd. Gowill has an indfinte usflife and is nt amortied, but s ealuated annuall for potentil mpament, or when events or crcumstanes indicate that it is more likely than not that the far value f th reporting unit is esthan its crrying amount. qualitative asment is pfomed to demine whether the existence f eents or cirumstances led to a determination that i as more likely than not the fir value was les than the carrying amount, inluding goodwill If, based on the valuation, it i ed to be more likely thnnt tht the far vl ws les thn the cg vale, then owill s test further for mpairment. Ifthe implied fair value of godwill s lower than it carrying amount, agoodwill impairment would be indicated and goodwil written down to its implied fair value.

Intangible assets that have finite useful lies, such as core deposit intangibles, are amortized over their stimated useful lives. The Companys core deosit intngbleassts repreent the value of the anticipated future cot savings that ill result from the acquired core deposit relationships versus an altemative source of funding. Judgment may be used in asessing goodwill and intangibl assets for impairment. Estimates of far value are based on proections of revenues, operating costs and cash flows of the reporting unit considering historical and anticipated futre rults, geneal eoomic and market condtions, as well as the impact of planned busins r oratioal strategies. The valuations use a combination of present value techniques to measure far value considering market factors. Additionally, judgment is used in detmining the useful lives of finite-live intangble assts. Advere hanges in th econmic vironment, operations of the reporting unt or changes in judgments and projections could result in a significantl different estimate of the fair value ofthe reporting unit and could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets.

Related Party Transactions - The Company extends credit and receives deposits from related parties. In management's opinion, the loans and deposits were made in the ordnary course of busines and made on similar tems as those reailing at the time wth other persons. Related party loans totaled $\$ 7$ million and \$8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Related party deposits totaled $\$ 91$ million and $\$ 74$ million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation - The Company accounts for all stock-based compensation transactions in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (\*ASC") 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires that stock compensation transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values on the measurement date. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occr. New shares are isued upon exercise of an award. The Company rcords permanent tax differeces through the income tax provision upon vesting or exercise of a stock-based award. The various stock-based compensation plans are described more fully in Note 17: Stock-Based Compensation.

Transfers of Financial Assets - Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surendered. Conto oer transfrred asset i demed to be surrenderedwhen: ) the ases have en isolated fromthe Cmpany and put presumptively beyond the reac f the transferor and its creditor, en in bankruptcy or ther reeivership ) the trnsfre bts the right (free f conditions that constra it from taking advantage f that right) to plege or exchange th transferred asets; and (ii) the Company do not mantin effctie contrl over the transferd ass through n agement to urchs thm before their matrit o th ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets.

Income Taxes - The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal and certain state income tax retuns on a consolidated basis Additionall, the Company and its subsidiaries file separate state income tax retuns with various sat jurisdictions. The provision for income taxes includes the income tax balances of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The income tax accounting guidance results in two componnts f iome x expnse:  rret; ad ) dered. Crren incme ax expense reflects taxes t be paid r rud for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excessof deductions over revenues. The Company detemnes dferred income taxes using the liabilit or balance shet method. Under this method, the net deferd ta sset or libilit i  nthe x f f th dffee twe th ok and x  f a and ilities andchng  ax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognizd if i is more likly thnnot, a on the tehnical merit, that the tax positio will be relid r sustaind upon examnation The term, more likely than not, means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigtion processes, if any. Atax position that meets the more likely than no rcogntion threshold is initially and ubsequenly measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a grater than 50 perent likelihood f being ealized upon settlement wth a taxing authority that has full owledge f ll relevant information. The deteination of whether or not a tax osition has met the more likely than not rcognition threshold onsiders the facts, cirumstances and infomation available at the reporting date and is subject to managment's jument. Defred a assts are rdud by a altion allowance f, base on the weight of eidnce aable, t is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of other non-interest expense.

Eamings Per Share - Basic earnings per share represent net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares oustanding durig each period. Dilute anings per hare reflect additional potential shres that would have been outstanding if dilutive otentil common stock had been isued, as well as any adjustment to inome that would resul from the assumed issuance. Potential common stock that may be issued by the Company is determined using the treasury stock method.

Derivative Financial Instruments - The Company records all derivatives on the statement of financial condition at fair value in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied th criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of th exposure to chnge inthe far valef an asst, liait, r fim cont trable to a partiular risk uch as inerest rate risk, are considerd far value edge.

In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\*FASB") fair value measurement guidance in ASU 2011-04, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instrments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counter-party portfolio.

Emerging Growth Company (EGC") - The Company is currently an EGC. An EGC may take advantage of reduced reporting requiements ad is relieed f  thr sigficant requremnts tha a therse gll applicable to ulic comanies. Among the reductions and reliefs, th Cmpany elected to extend the transition period for complying with nw o revised accounting tandards affecting public companie. This means that the financial statements the Company files or fumishes, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally alicable to public companie for the transition period for so long as the Company remains an EGC or untl the Company affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act.

# Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The following ASUs represent changes to current accounting guidance that will be adopted in future years:

# SU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures

Background - ASU 2022-02 provides new guidance on ( troubled debt restructurings (TDRs") and (ii)vintage disclosures for gross write-offs. The update eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and requires a company to determine if a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The update enhances the required disclosures for certain modifications made to borrowers experiencing financialdifficulty In addition, the update require disclosure of current-period gros charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. For the Company, the amendments are effective as of January 1, 2023. Impact of adoption - The Company expects to adopt the provisions of this guidance as of January 1, 2023. We have concluded that the adoption of this ASU will have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

The following ASUs represent changes to current accounting guidance that were adopted in the current year:

# ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments:

Background - ASU 2016-13 and its subsequent amendments provide new guidance on the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans held-for-investment and off-balance sheet credit exposures. The CECL model requires an estimate of expected credit osses, measured over the contractual life of an instrument, that considers forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. ASU 2016-13 requires new disclosures, including the use of vintage analysis on the Company's credit quality indicators. In addition, ASU 2016-13 removes the AFS

securities other-than-temporary-impairment model that reduced the cost basis of the investment and is replaced with an impairment model that will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities.

Impact of adoption - The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach. All disclosures as of December 31, 2022 are presented in accordance with Topic 326. The Company did not recast comparative financial periods and has presented those disclosures under previously applicable GAAP. The Company used the prospective transition approach for AFS securities for which other-than-temporary-impairment has been recognized prior to January 1, 2022. As a result, the amortized cost basis remains the same before and after the effective date of ASU 2016-13.

The following table illstrates the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 and details how outstanding loan balances have beer reclassified because of changes made to the Company's loan segments under CECL:

In connection with adoption of ASU 2016-13, changes were made to the Company's loan segments to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance under CECL. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio was separated into term loans and lIines of credit In addition, the remaining Paycheck Protection Program (\*PPP") loans were consolidated into the commercial and industrial term loan segment due to their declining outstanding balance. The Company also separated the residential and multifamily real estate loan segments. Refer to Note 4: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for detail on the loan segments.

# ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842):

Background - In February 2016, the FASB sued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases. The new standard established a right-of-use (\*ROU') model that requires a lesse to record a ROU asset and lease liability on the statement of financial condition for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classifie as either finance or operating, with clasification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of operations.

Impact of Adoption - The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2022. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 which, among other things, provided an additional transition method that allows entitie to not apply the guidance in ASU 2016-02 in the comparative periods presented in the financial statements and intead recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained eamings in the period of adoption. The Company did not recast comparative financial periods and has presented those disclosures under previously applicable GAAP. We also elected to apply certain practical expedients provided under ASU 2016-02 whereby we combine lease and non-lease components and we willnot reassess (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (i he lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (ii initil direct costs for any

existing leases. We also did not apply the recognition requirements of ASU 2016-02 to any short-term leases (as defined by relate.   
accounting guidance).

The following table illustrates the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statements:

Central acquisition-related costs totaled $\$ 8.3$ million for the year ended December 31, 2022, including a Day 1 CECL provision expense of \$4.4 milion, which were included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The results of Central are included in the results of the Company subsequent to the acquisition date and reported in this annual report on Form 10-K.

The Company determined that the acquisition of Central constitutes a business combination as defined in ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, s f the dat of th aqistion, the Cmpany reordd theats acquired and liabilities ssmed at far value. The Company determined fair values in accordance with the guidance provided in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. In many cases, the determination of these fir vales required management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and ther future eents that are highly subjective in natre and subjec to change. Actal reults could differ materialy. The Company has made the dtmination of fair values using the best infomation available a th time; owever, urchase accounting is not omplet and the asumptions used are subject change and if changed, could hae a material effct on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

Goodwill

In connection with the Central acquisition, the Company recorded $\$ 12.8$ million of goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes. The amount f goodwill recordd reflect the exanded markt preee, syrgi and opational efficiencies that are expcted o result from the acquisition. The following is a description of the methods used to detemine the far values of significant assets and liabilities presented above:

Cash and cash equivalents-The carrying amount of these assets was deemed a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short erm nature of these assets.

Loans, net-The fair value of loans was based on a discounted cash flow methodology. Inputs and assumptions used in the fair value estimate of the lon portfolio, iludes intrest rate, servicing, crt and liqudity risk, and required equity r. The far value of loans was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the remaning maturity and repricing terms. Cash flows were adjusted by estimating future credit losses and the rate of preayments. Projected monthly cash flows were then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted market rate for similar loans.

Core deposit intangibles-The Company identified customer relationships, in the form of core deposit intangibles, as an identified intangible aet. Core dosit intanges derive vlue fromthe exptd fure fits or ings capcity atritable to the aqu oe deposits. The core deposit intangible was valued by identifying the expected future benefits of the core deposits and discounting those benefits back to present value. The core deposit intangible will e amortizd over its estimated useful life of approximately 10 yars using the sum of the years digits accelerated method.

Deposits By definition, the fair value of demand and saving deposits equals the amount payable. For time deposits acquired, the Company utilized an income approach, discounting the contractual cash flows on the instruments over their remaining contractual live at prevailing market rates.

FHLB Advances - FHLB advances are recorded at their fair value as estimated by discounting the contractual future cash flows usin FHLB rates offered on similar maturities as of the acquisition date.

The fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities noted in the table may change during the provisional period, which may last up to twelve months subsequent to the acquisition date. The Company may obtain addtional information to refine the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities and adjust the recorded fair value.

# Accounting for acquired loans

Loans acquired are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit loses. Purchased-credit deteriorated loans (PCD) are loans that have experienced more than insignifican credit deterioration since orignation and ar recorded at the purchase price. Management determined that any loans which were past due, adversely risk rated, on non-accrual or considered a troubled debt restructured lan wre PD loans. The allowance for credit losse i detmined on a collective basis and is llocated to the individal lons The sum of the lons urchase price and he allowance for cedit lo eomes is intial orti cost basis. he differe etween the initial amortized cost asis and the par value of the loan i noncreit discount or prmium, which is amortie into inteest inome over the life of the loan.

Non-PCD loans have not experienced a more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. The difference between the fair value and outstanding balace of the non-PCD loans is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the lives of the loan.

A Day 1 CECL allowance for credit loses on the non-PCD loans was recorded through provision for credit lossexpense within the consolidated statements of operations. At the date of acquisition, of the $\$ 388.5$ million of loans acquired from Central, $\$ 20.5$ million, or $5 \%$ of Central's loan portfolio, were accounted for as PCD loans.

# Equity Securities

Equity securities consist of $\$ 2.9$ million of private equity investments. Equity securities are included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

During 2020, the Company acquired an $\$ 11$ million privately-held security in partial satisfaction of debts previously contracted. The Company used a discounted cash flow model, a market transactions model and a public valuation approach to detmine th security's cost basis. The Company elected a measurement altenative tht allows the ecurity to remain at cost until an impaiment is identified or an observable price change for an ientical or similar inestmet of the same issuer occurs. Impament is recordd when theris eidence that the expected fair value of the investment has declined to below the rcorded cost. No changes to the cost basis occurred in 2020. During 2021, the Company sold the equity security for $\$ 5$ million that resulted in a \$6 million realized loss.

The following isasummary of the recorded fair value and the unrealized and realized gains and losses recognized in net income or equity securities:

Net (losses) gains recognized during the reporting period on equity securities Less: net losses recognized during the period on equity securities sold during the period

Unrealized (loss) gain recognized during the reporting period on equity securities still held at the reporting date

The Company ggregates the loan portfolio by similar credit risk characteristics. The loan segments are described in aditional detail below:

Commercial and Industrial - The category includes loans to commercial and industrial customers for use in property, plant, and equipment purchases and expansions. Loan terms typicall require principal and interest payments that decrease the outstanding loan balance. Repayment is primarily from the cash flow of a borrower's principal business operation. Credit risk is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations.

The category also includes the remaining PPP loans outstanding. These loans were established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act which authorized forgivable loans to small businesses to pay their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The loans are 100 percent guaranteed by the SBA and repayment is primarily dependent on the borrower's cash flow or SBA repayment approval.

Commercial and Industrial Lines of Credit - The category includes lines of credit to commercial and industrial customers for working capital needs. The loan terms typically require interest-only payments, mature in one year, and require the full balance paid-off at maturity. Lines of credit allow the borrower to drawdown and repay the line of credit based on the customer's cash flow needs. Repayment is primarily from the operating cash flow of the business. Credit risk is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stabilit from business operations.

Energy - The category includes loans to oil and natural gas customers for use in financing working capital needs. exploration and production activities, and acquisitions. The loans are repaid primarily from the conversion of crude oil and natural gas to cash. Credit risk is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations. Energy loans are typically collateralized with the underlying oil and gas reserves.

Commercial Real Estate - The category includes loans that typically involve larger principal amounts and repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operations of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. These are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Credit risk may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the borrower's market areas.

Construction and Land Development - The category includes loans that are usually based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the completed project and include independent appraisal reviews and a financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Sources of repayment include permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing. Credit risk may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the borrower's market areas.

Residential Real Estate - The category includes loans that are generall secured by owner-occupied 1-4 family residences. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. Credit risk in these loans can be impacted by economic conditions within or outside the borrower's market areas that might impact either property values or a borrower's personal income.

Multifamily Real Estate - The category includes loans that are generally secured by multifamily properties. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on occupancy rates and the personal income of the tenants. Credit risk in these loans can be impacted by economic conditions within or outside the borrower's market areas that might impact either property values or the tenants' personal income.

Consumer - The category includes revolving lines of credit and various term loans such as automobile loans and loans for Other personal purposes. Repayment is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. Credit risk is driven by consumer economic factors (such as unemployment and general economic conditions in the borrower's market area) and the creditworthiness of a borrower.

# Allowance for Credit Losses

The Company established a CECL committe that meets a least quarterl to oversee the ACL methodology. The commitee estimates the ACL usig relevant available infomation, from inteal and extml soures, relating to past events, curent condtions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ACL represents the Company's current estimate of ifetime credit osses inherent in the loan portfoli at the statment f financial condition date. The ACL is adjusted for expected prepayments when apropriate and excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications.

The ACL is the sum of thre components: (i) aset specific / individual loan reserves; (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) eserves; and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves.

Asset Specific - When unique qualities cause a loan's exposure to loss to be inconsistent with the pool segments, the loan is individuall ealuated. Indvidal reeres are callated for lons that are risk-rated sustandard and on non-accrual and loans that are riskrated doubtful or los that are greater than a defined dolar threshold. In addition, TDRs are also indvidull ealuated. Rerves on asset specific ns may be asd on collaeral for collaealdndent ns, or on quantitative and qualiativ facors, inclding expcted cash flow, market sentiment, and guarantor support.

Quantitative - The Company used the cohort method, which identifies and captures the balance of a pool of loans with similar risk characteristics as of a particular time to form a cohort. For example, the outstanding commercial and industrial loans and commercial and industrial ie of cret lon sements as of quartr-end are onsidred cohort. The cohort is then tracked for loses over the remainng life of loans or until the pool is exhausted. The Company used a lookback period of approximately six-years to estabish the cohort population. By using the historical dat timeframe, the Company can establish a historical os factor for each of its loan sements and adjust the losses with qualitative and forecast factors

Qualitative - The Company uses qualitative factors to adjust the historical los factors for current conditions. The Company primarily uses the following qualitative factors:

The nature and volume of changes in risk ratings;   
The volume and severity of past due loans;   
The volume of non-accrual loans;   
The nature and volume of the loan porfolio, including the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit, Changes in the Institute of Supply Management's Purchasing Manager Indices (PMI) for services and manufacturing; Changes in collateral values;   
Changes in lending policies, procedures, and quality of loan reviews;   
Changes in lending staff; and   
Changes in competition, legal and regulatory environments

In addition to the current condition qualitative adjustments, the Company uses the Federal Reserve's unemployment forecast to adjust the ACL based on forward looking guidance. The Federal Reserve's unemployment forecast extends thre-years and is eventually reverted to the mean of six percent by year 10.

# Internal Credit Risk Ratings

The Company uses a weighted average risk rating factor to adjust the historical loss factors for current events. Risk ratings ioporat th rtitied  lay trties toicrtici ast, t st varius  f isk ontra ithin the regulatory Pass" category. Risk ratings are established for loans at origination and are monitored on an ongoing basis. The rating assigned to a loan reflects the risks poed by the borrower's expecte perfomance and the transaction's structure. Perfomance metrics used to determine a ris rating include, ut are not lited to, cash flow adequacy, liquidt, and collaal. A deriptio of the loan risk rating follows:

# Loan Grades

Pass (risk rating 1-4) - Considered satisfactory. Includes borrowers that generally maintain good liquidity and financial condition or the credit is currently protected with sale trends remaining flat or declining. Most ratios compare favorably with industry norms and Company policies. Debt is programmed and timely repayment is expected. Special Mention (risk rating 5) - Borrowers generally exhibit adverse trends in operations or an imbalanced position in their balance sheet that has not reached a point where repayment is jeopardized. Credits are currently protected but, if left uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or in the Company's credit or lien position at a future date. These credits are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to enough risk to warrant adverse classification. Substandard (risk rating 6) - Credits generally exhibit well-defined weaknesses) that jeopardize repayment. Credits are inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collteral pledged. A distinct possibility exists that the Company willsustain some lossif deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potentil, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classfied substandard. Substandard loans include both performing and non-performing loans and are broken out in the table below. Doubtful (risk rating 7) - Credits which exhibit weaknesses inherent in a substandard credit with the added characteristic that these weaknesses make colection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based on existing facts, conditions and values. Because of reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the assets, classification as a loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Loss (risk rating 8) - Credits which are considered uncollectible or of such littlevalue that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. The following tables present the credit risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio based on an internal rating category and loan segments:

The Company estimates expected credit losses for ff-balance sheet credit exposures unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for creit los expense. Thestimate is calulate for each lon segment and includes consideration of the likelihood that fundig willoccur and an estimate of the expecte credt losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated lif. For each pool of conractal obligations expected to be funded, the Company uses the reserve rate established for the related loan pools. The $\$ 9$ million allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures at December 31, 2022 is included in \*interest payable and other liabilities" on the statement of financial condition.

The following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures have been identified:

Loan commitments - include revolving lines of credit, non-revolving lines of credit, and loans approved that are not yet funded. Risks inherent to revolving lines of credit ften are related to the susceptibility of an individual or business experiencing unpredictable cash flow or financial troubles, thus leading to payment default. The primary risk associated with non-revolving lines of credit is the diversion of funds for other expenditures.

Letters of creit - are primarily established to provide assurance to the beneficiary that the applicant wil perform certain obligations arising out of a separate transaction between the beneficiary and aplicant. If the obligation is not met, it gives the beneficiary the right to draw on the letter of credit.

# Note 8: Derivatives and Hedging Activities

# Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its busines operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to  wide varit of busins and opertional risks through managment of its core busines activities. Th Company manages economic ris, including intrest rate iqudity, and cret rik primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its aets and liailities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Speificall, the Company enters intoderivative financial instrments to mang xoure tht arise from usiessctivies tht reult in the rit r payment of fre known ad urn cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.

# Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company uses interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company use inest rate swaps and collars as part of it intees rate rik managment strategy. Intees rate waps deinated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Intrest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract and hereit of variable-at amounts if interest ra fall low the flor strike rate on the contrct. During 202, such drivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variabl-rat lon asset. The five swaps that were entered ino in 2021 were terminated during the third quarter of 2022; however, the amortization of the gains on these instruments willstart in 2023 based onthe original effective dat ofthese swaps. The Cmpany also enterd into a new inteet rate collr during the third quarter of 2022. Derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges include one instrument with a notional value of $\$ 250$ million at December 31, 2022, and five instruments with an aggregate notional value of $\$ 100$ million at December 31, 2021.

For derivaties designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss (AOCr) and subsequently reclassfied into intest income or expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction afect aings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives willbe reclassfied to interest income and expense as interest payments are received and made on the Companys variabl-rat assets and iailies. The derivative financial istruments did not impact the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an $\$ 0.1$ million will be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense.

The Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period o 6.4 years.

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service provided to clients. The Company executes interest rate waps with ustomers tofacilitate ther respective risk management strategies. Those intees rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offetting derivaties that the Company executes with a third-party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such ansctions. ntet rate deiatiesoci wth his prog dot mee the strit hge accntig rquirement and changes in the fair value of both the customer derivaties and the offstting derivatives are rcognized directly in earnings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 49 swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $\$ 421$ million and 54 swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $\$ 535$ million, respectively.

The Company's derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, including swap fees eaned upon origination and credit valuation adjustments (VA") that represent the risk of a countrparty's default, are reported on the consolidated statements of operations as swap fee income, net. During 2022, the Company recorded net swap fees of $\$ 171$ thousand. During 2021, the Company recorded a $\$ 342$ thousand gain for CVA adjustments primarily related to one swap.

# Stock Settled Appreciation Rights

SSARs are granted based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock. SSARs typically vest in equal amounts over a seven year period, commencing on the first anversary f the effctive date of grant and have ftn-ar contractal tms for gacy Awards and ten-year contractual terms for all ther SSARs. Legacy Awards include retirement eligbility upon the participant's 65th birday, five yr f rticitio, and r  yr ing the grant. The rise f  ents the paticiant to the ess of the exercise price over the grant price for each SsAR. Exercise price is based on the fair market value of the Company's common shares.

The calculated value of each SSAR is estimated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. Expected volatility is primaril based on an inteal model that calculate the historical volatility of the ompany's stock since th IPO and several per group banks daily average stock prices before the IPO over the expected tem. The expected tem of stock granted represents the period that shares are expecteto be outstanding. The ris-fe rat for perios withn the contractual lif of the share award is ased on the U.S. Treasury yield curve.

For the expected term, the Company uses the simplified method described in SAB Topic 14.D.2. This method uses an expected term based on the midpoint betweenthe vesting date and the end of the contractal term. This method is used for the majorit of ARs, because the Company does not have asignificant pool f ARs that have ben exercised. For some SSARs that are granted to participants who wil be retirement eligible during the term of the award, a separate analysis is performed that focuses more on expected retirement date.

The following table provides the range of assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the weighted average grant date fair value, and infomation related to ARs exercised for the fllowing years, as well as the remaning compensation cost to be recognized and period over which the amount will be recognized as of the dates indicated:

# Note 20: Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is the price that would be rcived to sel an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction betwen market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

# Level 1

# Level 2

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   
Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities

Level 3

# Recurring Measurements

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying consolidate statements of financial condition, as well a the general classificatio of suc assets pursuant to the valuation hrarchy. For ats classfi within el 3 of the far value hrarchy, the process usedto deveop the rported fair value is described below.

Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans, Net f ACL - The estimated fair vale of collatealdependent loans is based on the appraised far alue of the collatral, les estimated cost to sell If the fair value of the collatral i below the lon's amortizd cost, the ACL is netted against the loan balance. Collateral-dependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company considers the appraisal or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factor. and events in the environment that may affect the fair value.

Appraisals are reviewed for accuracy and consistency by management. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. The appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost o sell if repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral.

Foreclosed Assets Held-for-ale - The far valueforecosed assets held-for-sal is based on the appraie far value f the colltral les estimated cost to sell.

Also, projections of any aluation of ffectiveness a t future priods are subject to the risk ha ontrols may ecome inadequate ause of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may detriorate. In addition, given the Company's size, operations and footprint, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time.

On November 22, 2022, the Company completed the merger with Central. The Company is in the process of evaluating the existing controls and procdures of Ceral and intrating Ceal into the intenal onrl over inancial orting process.
